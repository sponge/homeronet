      "(strongly and awkwardly) And in five\u2026four\u2026three\u2026 This is Dr. Rodney McKay speaking to you from my base of operations in the lost city of Atlantis, located deep within the Pegasus galaxy. I record this message on the eve of our darkest hour. As I speak, an alien armada of Biblical proportions is on its way, bent\u2014dare I say hell bent, in keeping with the metaphor\u2014on our destruction. We will do our best to stave off their attack, but I am afraid that defeat is all but inevitable. I and the other members of my team face the most horrific deaths imaginable as our very lives are-are sucked from our chests in a-in a\u2026a horrific\u2026okay, um\u2026 (uncertainly) Okay, starting again, starting again.

I want to say, um\u2026 I want to say something, uh\u2026 Family is important. I've come to realize that, because the people here have become a sort of a-a surrogate family to me. Now, I know what you're thinking. I've never really been the poster child for that kind of sentiment, but when one's contemplating one's own demise, one tends to see things more clearly. I really do wish you the best, you know, and I'm sorry we weren't closer. Perhaps, um\u2026 If by chance, I make it out of this, perhaps one day we can be. And I would like that. Now, if there's time, I'd like to go back to the subject of leadership.",
      "So, I'm in Atlantis, and I need to get to Earth. What do I do? Since we no longer have access to a ZPM due to\u2026unforeseeable circumstances, my only option would be to call the Daedalus and spend the next three weeks twiddling my thumbs waiting to get back home\u2026until now.  I give you the McKay-Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge. Thirty-four gates from both the Milky Way and Pegasus gate systems have been strategically placed in the massive void between our two galaxies. Simply enter on either side\u2014for example, Atlantis\u2014and boom! A macro that, uh, I have written especially for the occasion will command each Gate in the chain to store you in its buffer and forward you along to the next and the next, and the next, and the next, and the next, until you arrive\u2026here."

You look for them, you put up flyers, it's no use. And since your father refused to pay for a license, the animal shelter has no way of tracking him. You know, God knows what happened to that little guy. Now, cats\u2026now, that's a whole different story. I mean, cats are self-sufficient, they're dependable, you shake the box, they come running. The cynic would say it's because of the food, but my cat, see, I truly believe he enjoys my company. There's something very comforting about coming home from work at the end of the day and having a familiar face waiting for you, you know? Still, I digress. Where was I? Uh\u2026right. Leadership."

      "Look, I'm no MD, but wouldn't brain swelling on the visual cortex just mean that we experience washes of color or weird visual anomalies?",
      "I was just, uh\u2026I couldn't sleep, so I was going back up to the control room to do a little research. What about you?",
      "Yes. Life-sign systems indicate viability. According to the initial data I've been able to access, she's been in that chamber for ten thousand years.",
      "He raises a valid point. We've already established that the ZPM is nearly depleted, but it could be of some limited use to us.",

      "There was no way of determining that until the chair was initialized, and that was only possible once the Mark II was tied in.",
      "As I suggested, the entity's what's been causing most of our technical problems. Now, it was captured for observation. The Ancients were researching Ascension.",

      "Yes, but this is no ordinary game. I mean, it is incredibly challenging, instructional\u2026I mean the sheer number of options built into it? Staggering.",

      "Mmm. An anomalous spike the MALP picked up on a 'gate scout. The planet is uninhabited, but I thought it warranted a closer look.",
      "Look, no. Even if we could somehow manually dial, there's no power. Your pal Major Looney Tunes knew exactly where to set the charge.",

      "Yes, I know that's not a word, Mister\u2026Helpful. All right, look, maybe we could figure out some way to use the anti-replicator guns somehow.",
      "Our old anti-replicator technology relied on disrupting the bonds between each individual nanite cell. They just, uh, collapsed in a pile of dust, right?",
      "(worried) No\u2026It's the mass. It's collapsed the subterranean power grid. It's a black out. We're not going to be able to overload the ZPMs.",
      "Theoretically, that could work. Problem is, there's another hive ship out there. They'd be on top of us long before we'd finish the job.",
      "This is good news, right? It means all we have to do to shut this place down is get our hands on those ZPMs.",
      "It's kind of dangerous out there. I mean, the forest is crawling with Genii. Who knows when she could throw one of her fits.",
      "You mean Todd? He was our ally! Look, and even if he wanted to, there's no way he could hack into my system\u2026could he?",
      "We went back to M8G-352. We\u2026rescued you from Michael. I mean, he got away, but we got you back to Atlantis, safe and sound.",
      "Well, you survived for almost two years with Michael. I mean, shouldn't you have felt some kind of effects from this condition before now?",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. If he goes on this mission, it could kill him. We can't ask him to do this.",
      "(raising a finger) Unfortunately, believe it or not, Zelenka was actually right. We burned up way more power on the jump than we expected.",
      "I suppose once we steal the ZPM, I could utilize its power. Then I need to make sure that I don't overload the main\u2014",
      "I mean, we can, but not yet. Look, while Elizabeth's been connected, I-I've been going over the Replicators' base code, and I found this.",

      "He's right. They could target us, or-or for that matter, they could just jump back into hyperspace. We'd be right back at square one.",
      "Well, the second set of random blood tests just came back, all positive. They didn't see much point in, uh, quarantining the infirmary anymore.",
      "No, we don't know that for sure. Look, remember the nanovirus that caused the fatal aneurysms? I always suspected the Replicators were behind it.",
      "Yeah, but we know how they feel about the humans. They think we were a mistake. Look, we should've seen something like this coming.",
      "Right, right. Okay, so, cut. Okay, look at him. Do I get to cut the cord? I get to cut the cord then, right?",
      "We've come across them before. They're a-a real-time practically instantaneous link between two Ancient devices. They can be separated by like, half a galaxy.",

      "(over radio) I think I've overtaxed the drive. Look, it's not completely blown, but\u2026we've only got a handful of jumps before it's burned out.",
      "Okay, good. Good! I was wrong. We still have power; it's just not getting to any of the primary systems\u2026or the secondary systems, either.",
      "No, no, no. I disabled the jumper's network connection for this very reason. There is no way the anomaly jumped to the city's systems!",
      "(desperately) I'd put in fail-safes, a kill switch! Look, what I'm saying is that with all of the advancements I've been able to make\u2014",
      "No, we're going down. Water's already cresting the lower decks of the outer piers. It's going to breach the city corridors any second now.",
      "The basic model. You got it. I mean, no bells, no whistles. They'll be able to affect some minor repairs, but that's about it.",
      "I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm\u2026I'm sorry. I shouldn't have-I shouldn't have woken you up.",
      "I remember you not wanting me to say goodbye then! Why now all of a sudden? Look, and why one day? What's with that?",

      "Okay, so navigation's acting up. Look, whatever we decide, we gotta do it quickly because I cannot stay ahead of these malfunctions for much longer.",
      "It was activated on that end, it's the initial transmitter. The only way to sever the connection is to shut it down at the source.",
      "Well, simply put, it makes a psychic link between two people. So Doctor Keller and this\u2026.\"Neeva Casol\" have switched places. They're in each other's bodies.",
      "Believe me, I'm trying. Look, there's no way to access the control crystal. There doesn't seem to be a way to shut this thing off!",

      "It's a very weak signal. Look, if any part of that ship is intact, the wealth of scientific and military knowledge we could acquire is invaluable.",
      "Yeah, that's my point. All of our visions are so similar. If they're the result of arterial swelling, wouldn't the visions we experience be more random?",

      "I thought I would have time to get them out of here! (to O'Neill) Look, just forget what I said.",

      "Yeah. Flagecallus. I know, they were terrible at naming things. I-I've just, um, I've just called it \"whale\" for now.",
      "I'm warning you, you will probably be bored out of your mind. Unless you find incredibly advanced physics to be\u2014",

      "Um, I'm blocking out people's thoughts. It was, uh, becoming too overwhelming. I was, uh, I wasn't able to think.",
      "No-no-no-no-no. I know exactly what to do. You are the one who's lost a loved one. I will serve you.",
      "Oh my god! It's 0.03 hertz! I mean, I did it! I was in the zone; I could've actually ascended!",
      "No, it's obviously some kind of, uh, Ancient experiment, uh, social development, to try out different ways to create civilizations.",
      "(contrite) Yeah. Sorry about that. So\u2026it's like I said though, I\u2026I did what I did with the best of intentions.",
      "You used Wraith beaming technology for long-term storage? That's crazy! Well, the energy patterns couldn't possibly stay stable that long.",
      "According to the readings in here, your compartment was almost completely vented Look, it took almost a minute to re-pressurize.",
      "(hurriedly) The control room window's just been hit by a piece of debris from the explosion. It's about to breach!",
      "I have no idea how to determine who's who in this thing. Look, maybe if I had a few hours\u2026",
      "Yes, but I've already told you there's no way I can rig up a compatible power source for the jumper.",
      "You were the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. I'm really, really sorry. I should have just\u2014",

      "Excuse me, um, Lucius. Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners, but, uh, what is it exactly about you\u2026",

      "A star drive! Of course, the rumbling sound we heard. With the ZPMs, you're able to actively fly the city!",
      "Uh, it's a device that, uh, creates stable artificial wormholes that allows us to travel between other planets, even\u2026other galaxies.",
      "Already done. And after hearing what you've told me, I see no reason why we'd start it back up again.",
      "Otherwise, there are two bizarre things going on, and one is more than enough for me, thank you very much.",
      "Huh. If this works, we should be able to track every Aurora-class Replicator ship in the galaxy in real time.",
      "We have the technology. The understanding of nanite coding. I mean, we have the Ancients' blueprints, for crying out loud.",
      "I'm starving! Usually Flora feeds us some sort of food when we visit. Come on! You hardly ever eat yours!",
      "(to Sheppard) You really believe that Ladon would give the marching orders to kill a little girl? Even this one?",
      "It means that a lot of people, particularly alien women, tend to fall for John Sheppard's good looks and charm.",
      "Well, believe it or not, this place actually does control the beast\u2014if the beast is what I think it is.",
      "(also slightly winded) Oh, suck it up. It's not that bad. I have to hike this much almost every day.",
      "Are you talking about Neil Degrasse Tyson? He once stole an idea from me. Did I  tell you that story?",

      "Right. Uh\u2026well, after what happened to you, and\u2026and then Teyla, i guess he didn't feel comfortable on the base anymore.",
      "Do you have any idea how many gate addresses there are in the Ancient database that have no accompanying description?",
      "We've got nothing. There's no wreckage, no transponder signal. If he was down there, we would've found him by now.",
      "Well, it could be a ship. They're still too far too get any detailed readings, but that's gotta be them.",
      "Oh. Anyway, look, I wondered if I could\u2026tear you away from this long enough for us to have some lunch?",
      "We're just going to have to deal with them. I'm sorry, call me crazy, but I don't exactly trust them.",
      "Wait a minute. Maybe they are the same. That would explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a threat.",
      "We're not sure, but we have the best people in the world working on this and all the resources of\u2014",

      "(standing, annoyed) Okay. Let's go back to talking about how this is my fault, 'cause I think I like that\u2026",
      "Once they were done with the leukemia, they moved onto the heart murmur. And the easiest way to fix that\u2014",
      "No. No, but I think Sheppard was right. He was going to bring her here. We just\u2014we came too soon.",
      "Oh, it's Lamaze. It's supposed to help\u2026look, I don't know what I'm doing! What do you need me to do?",
      "Okay, on the count of three, I want you to push against the wall as hard as you can, okay?",
      "(stammering) I would've said \"regret.\" I would've said \"I really regret you being here because none of this would've happened\u2026otherwise.\"",

      "I have another idea. It's a long shot, but it might work\u2026but you're going to have to get off me.",
      "Look, I need you to go to the main power room instead. See if you reboot the system from there.",
      "(caustic) Again, I come back to my question of \"how?\" We have no way of getting to the jumper bay.",
      "(dubious) Okay, you want to harvest parts from both jumpers, cobble together a fix, so one of them will work?",
      "Exactly! They think I'm a shut-in. So\u2026I was thinking\u2026that, um, if I was to, say, show up with a woman\u2026",
      "No. No, Neil, you know, she's not my sister. This is Jennifer Keller. That's Bill Nye and(mumbling) Neil Degrasse Tyson.",
      "Just because I don't call anymore doesn't mean I'm keeping my urine in jars. Look, I don't need you to\u2014",
      "Aw, the cold temperatures are affecting the containment field emitters. I mean, they're weak, they're on the verge of failing.",
      "Yes, I've made all the necessarily modifications. But, for the record, I still say the shield is a better idea.",
      "Well, it must've happened in transmission, some kind of a glitch in the comm system. The original, it's all there.",
      "(sarcastic) Oh, great. So now we have to contend with starving Wraith who are just learning to use their teeth?",
      "You're telling me. The dart bay's on the other side of that. This is the only way out of here.",
      "Look, I was able to seal off the section so we won't depressurize, but you need to get down here\u2026",
      "A few. For starters, you don't have the Ancient gene, so you can't fly one, but you already know that.",
      "(dismissively) Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine. He's all perky and rosy cheeked and ready to go back to work.",
      "So, I was thinking that, uh, when you were feeling better, we could maybe, um\u2026you know, go for a ride.",
      "Yeah, you know, take the puddle jumper, go to the mainland, maybe have a picnic, maybe\u2026lay out under the stars?",
      "(rushed) Look, it's a long story\u2026just\u2026important thing is, if you're about to do what I think you're gonna do, don't.",
      "(desperate) Yeah\u2026but we're almost there. I mean\u2026look, did I say five minutes to recalibrate the DHD? I meant two minutes.",
      "(sighing) So we were wrong. It has been known to happen. Hey, I always said this was a long shot.",
      "Drop the shields. I will transfer all available power to the drive. Hopefully, it'll be enough to induce a jump.",
      "Hmm? Ah, it's not good. The main systems are completely fried. I'm going to have to do a full bypass.",
      "The explosion's caused a hull breach. Whole sections have been depressurized including the hangar bay. We just lost the jumpers!",
      "I've saved the relevant data. Minor adjustments, and I should have be able to have this thing up and running\u2014",
      "(annoyed) Hey, Sammy Skeptic, he saw it too! As did Ronon and Teyla. All of our primary systems went down.",
      "(impatient) Look, don't worry, all right? I will figure it out. I just gotta\u2026run a few diagnostics, narrow down things\u2026",
      "Well, hell yeah. But it's no more dangerous than allowing this thing to continue wreaking havoc on the city's systems.",
      "Oh\u2026I was\u2026I got so scared. I was sure that\u2026by morning what was left of my mind was gonna be gone.",

      "(into radio) The major is right. The only way to create an EMP strong enough to wipe these little guys out is\u2014",
      "I'm right, aren't I? The perfect health, the energy weapon the fact that she has the gene\u2026 It's the only logical explanation.",
      "Well, we could stand here looking at her all day. What we've got to do is get her out of this box.",
      "It's really a long shot, but I think it's most likely worth the effort. Of course, it'll mostly be my effort, so\u2014",
      "See, now you've got me wondering why the rest of the Wraith didn't want these experiments taking place in the first place.",
      "The satellite's fifteen hours away by puddle jumper. I recommend that we put together a small crew. Say, myself, Grodin\u2026and a pilot.",
      "If it seems like we can't fix it, we'll just turn around and come back. Now, I realize I'm invaluable everywhere, but\u2014",
      "Power is out in sections of the city. The long-range scanners and the internal sensors are down, but we're working on it.",
      "I am exhausted and starving, so sit down. Carson, it's out of drones. You couldn't do any damage if you wanted to.",
      "Well, why now? I mean, if it's possible, we knew we'd need as many people with the gene as we could get.",
      "I have less than twenty minutes to save our lives, and I am teetering on the brink of a hypoglycemic reaction, so\u2026",
      "Exactly. Now, at one point, the Wraiths and the Ancients were at war. The Wraiths created a transmission device to detect Ancients.",
      "Dr. Weir\u2026 The bad news is it looks like the device harnesses M7G-677's unique electromagnetic field. It probably wouldn't work for us.",
      "(over radio) I've parked the jumper outside the EM field, so we should be able to leave as soon as I've finished.",
      "It would take days or weeks at these levels of radiation, but I assume the Genii spend days or weeks down here.",
      "Either way you go, you need an amount of refined 235 roughly equivalent to the size of my fist\u2026or his fist, actually.",
      "Oh, same as before. All indications are that the gate's drawing power from the atmosphere, and there's enough for an eight-chevron lock.",
      "What's that? I didn't get all that. What do I do? Look, I'm getting good at the roll-y things. Maybe I can\u2026",
      "I was trying to do just that, but someone thought I should know the deep space sensors were back up and running.",
      "The cloak, for all intents and purposes, will replace the shield, which means that we'll be completely unprotected once the cloak's activated.",
      "Let me see if I can couch what Colonel Sheppard means by \"wow\" in more explicit terms. That is a terrible plan.",
      "Right. Of course. (becoming abashed) You know, you see\u2026 I would have thought of that myself before I became a drug addict.",
      "It's possible there was some sort of isolated power surge in this section. That would explain the lost camera, the malfunctioning door.",
      "All right, that leaves us one choice. We need to do a full system shutdown. We'll wipe everything, reboot, load clean backups.",
      "(having a panic attack) You know, I've never actually been inside one of these before today. It's a little, uh, cramped, huh?",
      "This should have worked. We've disabled every navigational computer in this bay. There's nowhere else on the ship the virus could hide.",
      "(to the departing Marines) Hey, wait, aren't any of you going to\u2026 ah\u2026 Okay, that\u2026 that's just reckless. There are four suits.",
      "Hey, I never said that, although the fact that you keep referring to yourself in the third person does indicate clinical dissociation.",
      "All right. Let's give this bad boy a try. (to the German scientist) Start her up, but slowly ease her into it.",
      "(as Cadman) Mm. Mainly because of Cadman. She's calming, you know? Between you and me, I am damn lucky it was her.",
      "You're the one who said set up rules. Well, I did. I followed them. I stuck to them! She basically hijacked me.",
      "You're referring to the ship you just shot down? The one that doesn't stand a hope in hell of ever flying again?",
      "The main power distribution conduit has been damaged. That effectively cuts all the power to the primary systems\u2014drive pods, cockpit controls, DHD.",
      "And desperate and losing a war they'd already been fighting for a hundred years. More importantly, they were\u2014they were, like, this close.",
      "Oh, see, look at his eyes, all lighting up again. It's Pavlovian. I crosschecked the logs. They were on a reconnaissance mission.",
      "No\u2026 I don't think so. I don't know, but I should get back in there and learn what this Wraith is doing.",
      "Colonel, this Wraith is controlling the program, which means it might have booby-trapped it as well. We're talking about Sheppard's life here.",
      "Fine. Can we at least go somewhere else? Can you get this off me? It's down my back. It's down my back.",
      "No, no, no. It's, uh, nothing to do with the, uh, the test. It's just our, uh, sensors are not working properly.",
      "But why? There may be a hundred or so of them? I mean, they could use us, they might even need us.",
      "Grounding station on the south pier's a bit twitchy. It got shot up. Wasn't our fault. You need to look at that.",
      "Oh, because I cross-referenced the renderings in the database with the whale outside and, you'll see the males have a rather prominent\u2026",
      "Well, it's still somewhat of a mystery how they're able to sense this trouble, but they do, often well before we do.",
      "Mmm. Misunderstood and unappreciated by many, his most formidable weapon was the power of his brilliant mind. Not just a hero\u2014a superhero.",
      "Exactly, so let me go out and start using my powers to do some good. Ooh, are you, uh, going to finish\u2026that?",
      "Trust me, this will work. I just need some more time. Now, stop talking so much. You're-you're rippling my pond. Hmm. Um-mm-mm-mm.",
      "Yeah, off and on in our spare time\u2014you know, uh, at night, between missions, I could've sworn we told you about it.",
      "It's the satellites! They must be tracking everything that's going on and then relaying it via subspace back to Atlantis. It's remarkable!",
      "Listen, you need to make peace with the people of Hallona. If-if tensions keep rising like this, it could lead to war.",
      "All right, you're all set. Once you're inside the shuttle, it should be fairly easy to get the device into the receptacle.",
      "(speaking over her) Look, I was just\u2014 I mean\u2014no, no, no, that was not a proposal. I was just-I was just talking.",
      "Has almost definitely been exposed, yes. Look, we need to find him before that tumor ignites, which could be any minute now.",
      "No, if I'd gone fishing, if I had checked the machine, if I hadn't assigned two junior guys to catalog the lab\u2014",
      "It's not accepting commands of any kind. There must be some kind of a-a command code that needs to be entered first.",
      "(pleased) Well, Zelenka's finally got communications back up. Turns out Atlantis had sent another jumper. It should be here within the hour.",
      "I think I just figured out how to disable the EM interference that is causing the shielding. (into radio) Sheppard, you there?",
      "(into radio) What is going on down there?! You have at least twenty-five Wraith closing in on your position from ground level.",
      "If they wanted to vaporize the city, they would've done it already! Look, if there's any part of this city left intact\u2014",
      "His code's changed. Until he's distributed it to the others in the next merge, he'll be different from the rest of them.",
      "Look, I have to at least figure out its purpose. They're probably right. It may somehow be linked to all of this.",
      "Yeah, I need to cut through this membrane. It's like surgery. It's more up your alley; maybe you ought to do it.",
      "(yelling) Look, Barasso is dead! And if we don't shut that generator down, we're going to be dead right along with him!",
      "Hey, if the patch job we did on the conduits hadn't slowed down the power loss? We'd have hit the deadline already.",
      "They're harmless! Look, I am a hundred percent certain they're not going to try to take her over or-or contact the others!",
      "(mouth full) Ah, but my instincts tell me that's because they're running an advanced masking system\u2014to fool us. They're good; I'm better.",
      "This is bizarre. I mean, I can't get it to give me a live feed. It's like it's-it's stuck in a loop.",
      "(into radio) I'm done. I've got total control over the power grid and the ZPMs, and Fran is\u2026Fran's just about to activate.",
      "Well, it doesn't make any sense. There's no way a single queen could provide enough genetic material to fertilize all those pods.",
      "(stammering) Well, bu\u2014I\u2026I was trying to take it back from her, and then she wolfs it down and hands me the wrapper!",
      "So what are the Genii doing here? And why do they want to kill her? I mean, aside from the obvious reasons.",
      "Well, did you see this? That's not going to budge unless we enter the right code. Look, these symbols are Genii numerals.",
      "If I had to? So, I'm to choose which one of those guys I would want to force themselves on me because\u2014",
      "(sadly) Oh. Oh, I suppose it was for the best. I mean, she deserves to be with someone who would've known that.",
      "No. Well, I mean\u2026maybe. Look, so we've ruled out advanced robotics, that still leaves us a-a half a dozen possible other explanations.",
      "You made a difference. We've got Michael on the run! It's just a matter of time before we catch up with him.",
      "(into radio) Indeed it is. Okay, there should be an open slot at the control panel you can plug the cable into.",
      "(confused, into radio) Oh, it is? Why am I not reading anything? Are you sure you plugged it in the right slot?!",
      "(over radio) Your guess is as good as mine, but I would err on the side of less time rather than more.",
      "Not good. Look, harnessing power from the ZPM is tricky. If I'm off even just the slightest amount, then we could all\u2014",
      "(voiceover) They ran a few successful ops against some of Michael's ground facilities, and then one day\u2026they got key piece of intel.",
      "I got everything. I've got gate addresses. I've got subspace communication codes. I've even got his research into the hybrids. He's history!",
      "No, no, no, no. I should be able to do this in my sleep. Oh god\u2026it's happening to me too, isn't it?",
      "(scoffing) What, you mean like a three digit code? You know how easy that would be to break? There's only six variations.",
      "Well, I never said \"destroy\", I mean\u2026it would lead to that, I suppose. But\u2026this device would stop them dead in their tracks.",
      "(impatient) Maybe we should just add it to the list of things that have nothing to do with the task at hand.",
      "All right, so the device creates a very specific subspace \"turbulence\" that makes it impossible for the Wraith to operate their hyperdrives.",
      "Not to mention those electrical discharges look pretty unfriendly, but\u2026Yeah, the antenna has a control crystal. If we can pull it manually\u2026",
      "Hey, what happened to your off-world foofaraw? I thought you were the guest of honor at some big diplomatic festival on M2J?",
      "When I was ten, I ate a bowl full of strawberries and threw up. I haven't been able to stomach them since.",
      "There you are. I've been looking all over for you. What, is your radio not working? I called like a thousand times!",
      "(unamused) Right. No. She's all alone in the infirmary. I just thought I would, you know, brighten the room up a bit?",
      "Not his first choice. He wants to send up a flare signaling the location of Earth to the rest of the Wraith.",
      "I have. Once, when we met another me, and once when we encountered another Daedalus. This signal was sent from another reality.",
      "And even if we do, then what, huh? I mean, Tyre's recovery hasn't exactly been the rousing success we were hoping for.",
      "Man, this ship has been through the wringer. No hyperdrive. Subspace communications are all damaged beyond repair. The shields are virtually depleted.",
      "(continuing) It's a drive all right. But it didn't move us through space. I think it's moved us into a parallel universe.",
      "Which is why you came here. You knew that Atlantis's computers were big enough and powerful enough to house your entire program.",
      "That's a last resort. We're not there yet. Meanwhile, I'll need it to effect any potential countermeasures I can come up with.",
      "(sadly) Yes. They were sent to a space gate. I guess that answers the question as to whether it was really Elizabeth.",
      "Hey, for me, this is fun! Just\u2026save me some ham. Whoa, there it goes again. It's like some kind intermittent gamma that's\u2014",
      "(spinning to Keller) Yeah, and as my parting advice, you need to stop letting these guys talk you into doing stupid things!",
      "(nervously) You think we've given them enough time? I mean, I don't want to interrupt if they're in the middle of medical\u2026",
      "Maybe we should wait. All right, I'm almost to the 'gate. I-I-I'll radio ahead, get a-a team here. Do a proper search.",
      "Wha\u2014I do not think it is wise for us to split up right now. We have no idea where the Wraith are.",
      "All right. Well, we'll take her to the 'gate, then I'll go back, tell people it's safe to return to the village."

      "Now that the grounding station's been deactivated electricity will be free to flow through the conduits that line every corridor in the city.",
      "Well, there's no other explanation. I mean, the power requirements of something like that must be astronomical. Only a ZPM could generate that.",

      "The hive ships will be in range of the satellite in 49 hours. We're going to need every last second of that time.",
      "Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let's not ruin the moment here, huh? Now\u2026keep an eye on my city for me while I'm gone, hmm?",
      "Well, I only know one thing for sure, and that is that flying darkness that eats energy can only be very, very bad.",
      "We're going with the assumption it was one or both of the drive pods. I don't know whether it was mechanical failure or\u2014",
      "Elizabeth, they live in trees. Atlantis would be a big step-up for them. Plus, they could stop killing themselves for no good reason.",
      "I don't know what I did. These things are usually plug and play. This device must be using an older version of Windows.",
      "Well, this is sort of a big moment, and I thought we haven't been in contact for some time. I just figured we\u2014",
      "Seriously, I'm getting, uh\u2026 I'm getting chills and hot flashes, chills and hot flashes, again and again. None of you are feeling that?",
      "Well, like I said, it's possible. Look, I recommend we drop out of hyperspace, run a full diagnostic on the power distribution systems.",
      "A lot of people knew we were running diagnostics, but no one knew we were in that particular room at that exact moment.",
      "Well, it's pretty smart. So far, everything we've tried, it's been one step ahead of us. (to the Bridge Lieutenant) Try it now.",
      "I will if I have to. Ford, I'm taking you in. Look, you may not believe this, but it's for your own good.",
      "I am perfectly capable of doing both at the same time. Now, I assume you've tried to run one of our own generators\u2026",

      "(as Cadman) Hey. You had a real opportunity to get inside the mind of a woman and actually expand your horizons. But, no.",
      "I told you the power feed would be intermittent at best. We should've dialed when I patched it instead of standing around talking\u2014",
      "Hah. Sorry, I wasn't listening, but it just struck me that this is an Ancient outpost. Why would the Wraith leave it intact?",
      "See that? See? See the way he lights up at the mention of that? It's like Dr. Vogel at the mention of pastry.",
      "When we activated the ZPM, the city must have sent out some kind of an automated subspace beacon, recalling ships back to Atlantis.",
      "Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air. (inspired) Wait a second.",
      "I don't know. Area 51, I guess. Tool around with as much of the database as we're able to bring back with us.",
      "It is\u2026remotely possible that in trying to rewrite Niam's base code, I\u2014we may have opened the door for them to make other changes?",

      "Look, we just need to step back and reassess the situation here, okay? We should be thinking about easing tensions, not inflaming them!",
      "It looks like some kind of rudimentary computer system, but it's locked up. Let me see if I can reboot it\u2026get power online.",
      "Yeah, but you see, that's what scares me. I mean, at some point, you're going to know me the way they know me\u2014",

      "I said I knew its last known location. It is a mobile drilling station, remember? Obviously that\u2019s going to take a few hours.",
      "(over radio) You know, this station has been lying idle down here for a few millennia. We're bound to blow a few fuses.",
      "As far from the \"quo\" as it gets. Look, Teyla didn't just shut down several key systems. She scrambled the existing operating codes.",
      "No, no, no, no, you had to be bait, because she was expecting you to be the one trying to fly the ship.",
      "What? No, no, no. We haven't finished what we came here for. Look, Wraith's gone. We've got a ton of research to do.",
      "Okay, will. I mean, dead in their tracks, like hitting the pause button. I mean, temporarily, until they\u2026figure out how to override it.",

      "I don't know. What little power we had night is almost gone. We'll be lucky if we can make it through the night.",

      "(to technician) Hmm\u2026Yeah. (to Sheppard and Teyla) All right, two bits of good news. One, I've been able to calculate our exact location.",
      "Happy? Huh, there's actually a chance we might make it through this thing. I am ecstatic! I am going to do a little\u2014",
      "It's a streamlining program designed to boost its operating efficiency. Look, the 'gate will be offline for what, one hour? Two hours tops.",
      "Well, turns out that trying to create something much simpler is, ironically, much more difficult. In the end, I was forced to compromise.",
      "My favorite missions are when we come here to do our trading. And I've said that\u2014I can prove it. I'm not just\u2026saying that.",
      "It means that you have a very annoying attitude, but I'm willing to cut you some slack because you're still just a child.",
      "They haven't been doing much of anything lately. When the Wraith discovered what they were up to, the whole civilization was wiped out.",
      "Look, don't say anything. Okay? It's no big deal. You're gonna go into the stasis pod until we\u2026figure out how to fix you.",

      "(voiceover) I got a high-paying job with an aerospace engineering firm. Jennifer started her own practice. Things were just starting to come together.",
      "Maybe he felt sorry for me, maybe he figured it wasn't going to work anyway, but\u2026he let me through. The rest, you know.",
      "A lot of time has passed since the Ancients were around. You know, things change. Maybe there's something here they didn't know about.",
      "And having an active, uh, crystal allows us to, uh, calibrate these hand-held sensors to, uh, detect the energy signatures associated with it.",
      "Yes. They're, uh, they're a little shaken, but they're okay. I put a security detail on them, so you don't have to worry.",
      "Because I got all mixed around. We've got to start again. Maybe what I thought was north was south. It's hard to tell.",

      "Beats me. (keying radio) Radek? Come in. Control room, it's Dr. McKay. We just lost power on the East Pier. What's going on?",
      "(caustic) No, a \"force field\" around the control room and the gate room. Look, while it's in place, we're not getting in there.",
      "Yeah, it's a great plan. It's just\u2026I'm just not sure I'm entirely clear on how you intend on doing the actual \"blowing up.\"",
      "It's like I said. I mean, both the jumpers are toast. This one's got a whole whack of problems starting with zero power.",
      "(into radio, worried) Look, security's on the way. I ne-I need you just to-just to sit tight and try to stay warm, okay?",
      "But it's only capable of powering itself to a certain extent, right? I mean, it has a finite amount of power generation capability?",
      "Hey, my contract with SGC is up this year. Maybe it's time for me to move on, time for me to\u2026do other things.",
      "(into radio) I know! I know! Power fluctuations. Look, it's like I said. Some of the ship's systems are acting up a little.",
      "(sighing) Okay, all right. You know what? Just go ahead. Boy, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the pod this morning.",
      "There we go. It's probably just a dead battery. Come on, it's schnitzel day. We've got to hurry though, 'cause it's going fast.",
      "(concerned) Yes. I've been going over the SGC files on that, and there's still a lot of unanswered questions about how it works.",
      "I don't know about that. According to Jennifer, her accomplice was just about to kill her when we shut down the communication terminal.",
      "If John Sheppard hadn't found that Wraith when he did, that transmission definitely would've made it through to Pegasus. He saved our asses.",
      "It's got to be something to do with Michael. I mean, she hasn't been offworld since she helped rescue us from that lab.",
      "Todd said the ship isn't finished, right? They haven't adapted the full potential of the ZPM. Well, maybe the battle maxed them out.",
      "(hyper) Look, the hyperdrive hasn't been operated at full power in over ten thousand years. It's not surprising there are a few glitches.",
      "As they got further and further from their own reality, I guess they figured they'd need it to get back. And\u2026here we go.",
      "Oh, don't look at me. I haven't had time to route the main systems to these control panels. I'm flying blind down here.",
      "Oh, I know what this is. It's your first mission back. Look, I am not about to let it be your last, okay?",
      "The drive's charging a lot faster now. (into radio) Sheppard\u2026.looks like the next jump's going to happen a lot sooner than we thought.",

      "Which would make us, uh\u2026 Right, I think.",
      "Really, you need to start calling me Rodney.",
      "Everything's great. Everything's really\u2026 Why wouldn't it be?",
      "It's a gate address, a six-symbol gate address.",
      "Look, I've tried it twice, backwards and forwards.",
      "Representing the five Protectors and the Master Handler.",

      "Well, the magic Ancient device hasn't lied yet.",
      "Oh, brilliant. Okay, Miller, break out the straws.",
      "Let's take a look at this first panel.",

      "(into radio) Okay\u2026 Let's give it a test.",
      "Well, like I said, we have a problem.",
      "Well, you know me, always eager to help.",

      "Well, thanks for not saying the other thing.",
      "Yes, yes! Hurry up and get us back!",
      "Zelenka. Why can I never remember that name?",
      "(into radio) Thank you. Now we're getting somewhere.",
      "Yes, what have you got there? Any food?",
      "No, no, you'll get blown out into space.",
      "(voice slurred) That's what I'm trying to say.",
      "It's a command subroutine I've never seen before.",
      "Any significant energy emission generally indicates technological civilization.",
      "If they have a ZPM, yes, we can.",
      "So you are expecting it to happen again.",
      "(looking sideways at Sheppard) Fifty years you say?",
      "And he indicated this to you by blinking?",
      "Well, if you know where the village is\u2014",
      "They are capable of stopping bacterial infections entirely.",
      "Well, radioactive readings, your fascination with our C-4\u2026",
      "It's the flash memory of a jump drive.",
      "Meaning that there may be some disassembly required.",
      "We're ready to begin work on the DHD.",
      "(jumping to his feet with surprise) Present. Yes.",
      "Because we need to get the shields up.",
      "(angrily) I assume that's him in that Jumper.",
      "Are we speaking in relative terms, or, um\u2026",
      "(standing, furious) Are you out of your mind?",
      "Huh. And you got all that from, uh\u2026this?",
      "(intrigued) It's okay. Let's see what you got.",
      "Don't just stand there. Get me more enzyme.",
      "(shouting) No. Don't shout. I am right here.",
      "That's true. I just think that if we\u2026",
      "That would work. Those systems are still clean.",
      "(nudging an airman out of the way) Move.",
      "My nose is peeling. Do you have moisturizer?",
      "We've been walking around in circles for hours.",
      "Yeah, I've had it. Drop your weapons now!",
      "That's very clever, but we're not equal forces.",
      "(as Cadman) I don't know. Let me try.",
      "(furious) I said, \"Slowly ease her into it!\"",
      "(pointing at his head) She says she's tired.",
      "No, it is completely out of the question.",
      "(as Cadman) Yay! Paper beats rock. We leave.",
      "(as Cadman) Just in case this doesn't work.",
      "Oh, good to hear. (to Zelenka) Nice work.",
      "Same here. It's, um, it's been a while.",
      "Who am I, MacGyver? Fix it with what?",
      "I'm sorry, was there a compliment in there?",
      "I assume there's no DHD beside the Stargate?",
      "I'm not. It's broken. You don't understand \"broken?\"",
      "You are asking me to do the impossible.",
      "What? Why does he say that to me?",
      "Right now, uh, ten minutes, give or take.",
      "That would explain the lack of life signs.",
      "Yes, \"wow.\" I just\u2026I want to be sure.",
      "I can compensate. Just give me a minute.",
      "(shocked, facing Sheppard) I can't shut it down.",
      "The weapon's discharging to prevent a catastrophic overload.",
      "Seriously, have you seen anything like this before?",
      "Well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too.",
      "Uh, medical research is not really my thing.",
      "But, I mean, I can stay\u2026and help Beckett.",
      "I said I doubted he was lucid enough.",
      "Were you able to communicate with the Captain?",
      "This is Wraith gear. And it's recently installed.",
      "Thank you. Thank you so much for that!",
      "Would it have killed you to tell me?",
      "What? Don't just stand there. Cut me loose.",
      "The space suits were stored in those sections.",
      "(distracted) Mm. Mm. Yeah-yeah-yeah. I'm sure he's fine.",
      "Ah, well, we try and make contact, obviously.",
      "It's an Ancient warship. It's possibly Aurora class.",

      "The Control Room should be almost directly below.",
      "I am working as fast as I can.",
      "They brought their ZPMs to power the stardrive.",
      "Ha! It worked! I can't believe it worked!",
      "Hey. How long have you been standing there?",
      "No! Look, now if I widen the scan\u2026",
      "(breathing erratically) It's, uh\u2026now my head's hurting too.",
      "I thought we were moving away from them?",
      "Ah, well, that, uh\u2026that I don't know yet.",
      "That would be my assumption as well, yes.",
      "Well, a lot of animals: whales, dolphins \u2026",
      "Wow! Well, now we know what caused it.",
      "No, suicidally close. I mean, we'll be toast.",
      "Anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.",
      "I told you this wasn't a good plan!",
      "Well, we could call it, uh, strategic concealment.",
      "That's what this is all about? Killing Sheppard?",
      "(piqued) Yes, yes. We all know what happened.",
      "All right. It's gonna be around here somewhere.",
      "Okay, you know what? Watch this! I'll uh\u2026",
      "(mouth full) I have a very active metabolism.",
      "No! Just give me a second. I know.",
      "(excited) I had this shipped from the SGC.",
      "Now, if you don't mind, can we, uh\u2026",
      "Hope you don't mind. I just healed them.",
      "Right, there you go. We did tell you.",
      "I offered you an entire crop of beans.",
      "Yeah, well more agreeable than \"Richard the Lionheart\".",
      "He entered the command on your game console.",
      "I tried that! It's already on the way!",
      "What? No. That's ridiculous. How could we vanish?",
      "(rolling his eyes) Yes, that's clear. McKay out.",
      "(panicked, over radio) I've got a problem here!",
      "No. No, we don't leave our people behind.",
      "You know, technically, I-I didn't take that bet.",
      "Hey, you know if it was anybody else\u2026",
      "Yeah, next week. I'm-I'm one hundred percent there.",
      "I don't know. Look, I got to go.",
      "Ah, well, long story short: it creates\u2026explosive tumors.",
      "(voice breaking) I know\u2026and, uh\u2026that's what's killing me.",
      "There is no Wraith here, I'm telling you!",
      "I am walking as fast as I can.",
      "(panicking) She's not dying according to plan here!",
      "Well, it looks like they abandoned the place.",
      "That explains why the wounds look so familiar.",
      "Let's hope it's the only bug they brought.",
      "I doubt the Taranans did this to themselves.",
      "Well, I think it's out in the tunnel.",
      "(panicked) Go! Go! Go! Go! Sheppard! They're hatching!",
      "Eh, you're preaching to the choir, my dear.",
      "Everything in a three mile radius is toast.",
      "Well, I suppose we could not incinerate them.",
      "We couldn't hit the side of a barn!",
      "Well, that I might be able to do.",
      "It's the other hive! We're taking multiple hits!",
      "We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.",
      "No, no, well we're here now, and uh\u2026",
      "Oh, you're just taking his word for it.",
      "It was a\u2014one teeny-tiny taste, for research purposes.",
      "Fine. (under his breath) Story of my life.",
      "I take it he was talking to you?",
      "How can you not recognize the 'gate address?!",
      "(drunkenly) So many colors! All the pretty horses.",
      "(groaning) How long did you work on that?",
      "(over radio) They outnumber you twenty-five to three.",
      "I can walk fine, I just can't sit!",
      "I assume that you, um, built them yourselves?",
      "(annoyed) He says the other Ancients are arrogant?",
      "Yeah, well how many PhDs does he have?",
      "Yeah, well it may very well be longer!",
      "What were the nanites originally designed to do?",
      "What are you crazy? She can infect you!",
      "(panicked) This is pretty much my top gear!",
      "None, but we're receiving an analog video signal.",
      "So, instead you\u2014having what it took\u2014overthrew Cowan yourself.",
      "What kind of a plan would that be?",
      "(chuckles) Yes, well, if the math checks out.",
      "Do you have any idea what you've written?",
      "(low, to Jeanie) I sure hope he's kidding.",
      "She's four. How good could she possibly be?",
      "We work for something called the Stargate Program.",
      "Containment field is holding. Power generation is steady.",
      "This is not the time or the place.",
      "(impatient) Yes. How exactly did you get here?",
      "Something more permanent?! Well, we're not keeping him!",
      "There aren't two McKays! There's one McKay and\u2026him!",
      "What were you doing having breakfast with him?",
      "(hurt, defensive) It wasn't like that at all.",
      "(into comm) Hermiod, this is McKay. Commence transport.",
      "If you can convince Kaleb\u2026not to make Tofurky.",
      "(impatiently) Well, what?! Person, animal? How many syllables?",
      "Oh for god's sake, enough with the bodies!",
      "Ah, it's the beauty of hybrid organic design.",
      "(panicked) I don't think we have the time.",
      "(contrite) You're in charge. I know. I'm sorry.",
      "(to control room staff) Okay. Here we go.",
      "(reeling) Oh my god. Uh, are you sure?",
      "Yeah\u2026yeah, we know they have a few ZPMs.",
      "Are you catching any discrepancies on your end?",
      "Well, why didn't the sensors pick it up?",
      "And yet it came out in one piece.",
      "(panicking) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Wh-wh-Wait, hey, what are you doing?",
      "Well, that doesn't mean they can't be erased.",
      "(protesting) I didn't break it. It's working fine.",
      "(stunned) You look and sound just like her.",
      "But Plan B, it's not a good plan.",
      "Well, you didn't let me finish my presentation.",
      "Either way, they want to stop losing ships.",
      "Hey, I should\u2026just get back to my lab.",
      "Will you stop that? I was never gone!",
      "Okay. This won't take more than a minute.",
      "(over radio) It's not as simple as that!",
      "(more meek) Plus, they usually land the ship?",
      "We are\u2026but someone cut it out of him.",
      "Well, what say we keep it that way?",
      "I'm definitely going to have nightmares about that.",
      "And now fate decides to restore the balance.",
      "I'm\u2026fine. Uh\u2026yeah\u2026 Wow, this is much more, uh\u2026",
      "Never underestimate the size of that man's ego.",
      "Well, it doesn't really matter anymore, does it?",
      "We don't beat people where we come from.",
      "Well, you can't just take it like that!",
      "What's going to happen when Sheppard finds out?",
      "Oh, please, who are you going to believe?",
      "(fuming) I guess she forgot to mention it.",
      "(sarcastic) But your little knife will protect us.",
      "(worried, into radio) You mean like teeth marks?",
      "Hating to agree with the child, but, uh\u2026",
      "Well yeah, before they started shooting at it.",
      "I'm particularly not fond of the ceiling work.",
      "It-it's heights! I'm probably worse than she is!",
      "(to Carter) Oh, yes. Good. Great idea. Yes.",
      "Would it have killed you to show 'em\u2014",
      "Yeah, but I didn't mean to. It slipped.",
      "(whining) But there's gotta be hammer and nails!",
      "Look, we just have to build a bridge.",
      "(aghast) Ibuprofen?! That's the strongest thing you've got?!",
      "(defensively) Barely? Were you not watching? It was\u2014",
      "Oh\u2026you-you want to have to have a drink?",
      "(irked) I'm working as fast as I can!",
      "(tightly) That doesn't really matter now, does it?",
      "Lasted about a day, sealed himself in there.",
      "(pleased) Oh, it was no trouble at all.",
      "(whining) Aw, come on, we just got back.",
      "No, scans would've picked it up right away.",
      "Well, they won't. I would block any attempt\u2014",
      "I did it! I mean, well\u2026she did it.",
      "(to Ronon) Hey, get out of that! Hey!",
      "I-I don't know. Sh-she just-she just ran out.",
      "(over radio) So what do we do now?",
      "All right. (into radio) Radek, how we doin?",
      "Well, something similar has just happened to you.",
      "Oh, seven, eight hundred years. A thousand tops.",
      "(defensively) Well, I wasn't programmed for this variable.",
      "Oh. Oh, then-then you know what that means.",
      "(frustrated) I am trying! It's like I said\u2026",
      "(encouragingly) There you go. You can do it.",
      "(affronted) Why do you find that so surprising?",
      "It's obviously nothing. I did that yesterday. Look\u2014",
      "I hardly think that's what this is about.",
      "Or the Wraith version of a vending machine.",
      "I take it you're not a big fan\u2014",
      "Okay, fine, so\u2026what do you want from me?",
      "Exploring the Pegasus Galaxy. It's what we do.",
      "You don't really think Zelenka would do that?",
      "Please, you want bizarre? Let me tell you.",
      "Teyla had a dream about you last night.",
      "Ha ha! There you go. Better get started.",
      "(petulant) Oh, thanks. Like I have much choice.",
      "I mean, I thought there'd be more\u2026hot girls.",
      "Aw, I knew it! That is so typical!",
      "(unenthusiastic) Oh. Uh, well, I'll come\u2026 with you.",
      "(raising voice) Does anyone here know Teyla\u2026? Anyone\u2026?",
      "Are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?",
      "(desperate, sarcastic) Oh, then it should be easy.",
      "Great. Just what we need, another bad guy.",
      "I got lifesigns, there, there, there, and there.",
      "We estimated somewhere between fifty and seventy-five thousand.",
      "(into comm) Sam, that's it. We got it.",
      "No, it-it's fine. I'll do it myself, thanks.",
      "You know. What do you mean, you know?",
      "Okay, well I need to get to Vancouver.",
      "Canadian Security Intelligence Services. They're\u2026kinda like our CIA.",
      "Okay, we do not know that for sure!",
      "What are you going to do with us?",
      "(panicked whisper) Jeanie! Jeanie, what are you doing?",
      "Yeah, well it's the only one I got.",
      "Well, let's not get out of control, here.",
      "Uh, it was great. Bought 'em a Prius.",
      "Still, you talked a man into killing himself.",
      "I'm fine. It's just a\u2014just a couple scrapes.",
      "Seriously, I'm okay. Just\u2014you should look after Lorne.",
      "Right, right. Right. Got it. Okay. Follow me\u2026",
      "(panicked) Look, can't you just hold it in?",
      "I told you, you should have stayed here.",
      "(flatly) Oh, that's funny. Where are you going?",
      "(intrigued) Well, did this assistant happen to mention\u2026",
      "Please, just\u2026humor me. I think I'm onto something.",
      "Well, the wall would break apart your body.",
      "A subspace signal. It's the only possible answer.",
      "(whimpering in pain) Oh. Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.",
      "I think I know what this thing does.",
      "Well, it will once I light it up.",
      "Whoa! We'll both go! No need for that.",
      "Well, then, we need to create a diversion.",
      "Explosion diversions are the very cornerstones of diversions.",
      "All right, you look watch the\u2026aw, come on!",
      "Well, aside from encrypting access to this workstation\u2026?",
      "(forlorn) I'm-I'm pretty sure we're on our own.",
      "Well, you know me. It's function over fashion.",
      "(affronted) Excuse me? I said no such thing.",
      "I don't believe I ever finished that sentence.",
      "Oh, let's hope it doesn't come to that.",
      "(smugly) Guess that didn't work out so well.",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We get the picture.",
      "Will you just tell me what's going on?",
      "(staticy, over radio) Sheppard, do you read me?",
      "Is there any advanced technology in this \"coalition\"?",
      "(focusing on his hand-held) Well, we disable it.",
      "Well, it's just\u2026I'm\u2026what you're about to do is\u2026",
      "Well right, well, you know\u2026here's to many more.",
      "Whoa. I'm sorry. Sorry, we were just\u2026you know.",
      "(concerned) What\u2014he did? Why would he do that?",
      "Yeah, FYI, this conversation ended six seconds ago.",
      "(uninterested) Well, have a little lie-down. It'll pass.",
      "(snide) No, he's not. He came back yesterday.",
      "I think maybe this was a bad idea.",
      "Well, I just\u2026remembered I don't\u2026really like these people.",
      "(scornfully) Well, it's a little late for that.",

      "Okay. Cloak's engaged. They should be here momentarily.",

      "What, so you\u2026came up to the jumper bay?",

      "So not me. Right. Okay. No. Bad idea.",
      "And yet, I am still smarter than you!",

      "Yes! He needs more power than he has!",
      "(sighing) It's like a needle in a haystack.",
      "Well, someone stole our jumper off that ship.",
      "(uncomfortably) Yeah, well, don't get used to it.",
      "Of course it's not. It's an alien organism.",

Now, at the time, I just assumed that was an effect of the gate's residual energy signature. But having given it some thought, I realized that can't account for such sizable variances, which leaves only one possible explanation. The gate must have been energized on our arrival, meaning it doesn't just draw power on outgoing wormholes, but on incoming wormholes as well. All we have to do is make a connection. 3.5 microseconds, that's the minimal amount of time it requires to confirm a lock before the gate automatically kicks in, drawing power from the atmosphere to maintain the wormhole."

      "It's not as bad as you think! I stripped down its programming as much as I possibly could without sacrificing basic viability. It can walk, it can talk, but it can't replicate or change its form or anything.",
      "The log didn't specify. But whatever this thing is, they talk about this thing like it was sacred. From what I can gather, it played a pivotal role in helping the Wraith win their war against the Ancients.",
      "All right, look\u2026if we're actually going to do this, I figure we need to stack these things, like, twenty feet high in order to climb out. So no matter how we build it, it's going to be unstable.",

      "All right, we're redirected. We gate from Atlantis to M6R-125. We insert this crystal with the bridge macros into the DHD, dial the first gate in the void, and we're back on track all the way to Midway.",
      "Well, they blindfolded him every time they moved him, so he couldn't see the DHD. Although, he did catch a glimpse of an address dialed by one of Michael's, uh, mercenaries. That could be a place to start.",

      "All right, well we may need to think about, uh, ordering all non-essential personnel to report to the mess hall. I mean, they're gonna wind up there anyway. And this way, we won't have people wandering the hallways.",
      "Yeah, it's a long story. What I'm trying to say is, this program that we're pushing on it is designed to, uh, restrain them, very specifically, to make sure they don't get out of control. So much so\u2014",
      "No, they\u2014they\u2014 Wait, I know. I need to get back to a data terminal. A lot of their internal power's down. Maybe I can short out their jamming code. We can get the Daedalus to beam us out.",
      "Okay, there is no way this is a coincidence. I mean, we discover Janus's super-secret lab, and less than twenty-four hours later, a bunch of aliens show up all guns blazing? Don't you think that's a little odd?",
      "Well, the Daedalus has already picked up a 'gate, uh, leftover from the old Gate Bridge, and, uh, my team is installing it as we speak, so we should have you home in, uh, no time at all.",
      "(drily) The Federation had ships. Look, what do we hope to gain from this? I mean, the only reason these people even know about each other is because they happened to inherit the 'gate system from the Ancients.",
      "Well, you just have to fly up to the tower, get in proximity, dial the DHD to a random planet. We'll have Radek lower the gate shield, allowing the vortex to obliterate Michael's puddle jumper\u2026or most of it.",

      "And I know what you're implying, all right? But my mind was clear. All right, that device was found because of my brilliant thinking, and, as much as I hate to admit it, a little help from Zelenka.",
      "(after a pause) Yes. Yes it does. I'm sorry. I know I'm supposed to be humble. I know I'm not supposed to care. But I do, I really do. And that's\u2026well, that's something you should know about me.",

      "No, no, no, no, no. Look, we just want to take a look at it. This may sound strange, but we think it may have been inadvertently activated, and it's\u2026well, it's causing some problems for us on Atlantis.",
      "I know everything about you. You've never been married. The only thing you own is a car. You have $2,363.00 in the bank and are $13,000.00 in debt\u2026not counting the off-the-books gambling losses to a guy named \"Mikey.\"",
      "(hesitating a moment) Look, we know that the Wraith don't need to feed as often as the target does. I mean they feed for pleasure, but not in this case. Not if it means leaving a trail behind.",
      "Why else would they leave like that? It can't be a coincidence. The Wraith know that Earth is a much richer feeding ground than anything in the Pegasus Galaxy, and they've been looking for those coordinates for years.",
      "Well, not directly. It's impossible to calculate the relative position of our original starting point from where we are now. But we can retrace our steps, passing through each reality in turn until we reach the right one.",

      "(without conviction) No, we'll be fine. We just, uh\u2026we'll be fine.",
      "(furious, to Sheppard) It was Todd! That bastard hacked my system!",
      "(continuing, into radio) I'd say a lot of it's just missing.",
      "A bunch of kids going through what's left of the place.",
      "We already know. At least, we have a pretty good guess.",
      "One of our people, Teyla, was taken by a dart today.",
      "This was no culling. She was targeted. Someone set a trap.",
      "Well, like alternate timeline, parallel universe, cloning\u2026you know, take your pick.",
      "I know this is a lot for you to take in\u2026",
      "Okay, when I say, go ahead and try the left one.",
      "Oh, plug and play, huh? What, you think it's that simple?",
      "Uh, no. In fact, you were sent forward, into the future.",
      "(voiceover) Eventually though, we managed to get her in working order.",
      "(voiceover) They started a series of hit-and-run ops, real guerrilla style.",

      "Uh\u2026\"Thank you, Rodney.\" No, no, no\u2026wait a minute, you mean the\u2026",
      "Oh, of course. I mean, I'll be fine. I'm just\u2026with you\u2026",
      "Huh, no, no\u2026No, actually, you've-you've caught him on a good day.",
      "Okay, I may have made a few small adjustments. So what?",
      "Come on! You guys kill me! Planets are huge you know.",
      "Or there is, but the Ancients are trying to hide it.",
      "Okay, well there's got to be more of them around here.",
      "Ah, you lost the bet. There's definitely something on this planet.",
      "Don't look at it. And whatever you do, don't touch it.",
      "What did you need me for? What's with the rubber walls?",
      "Oh, thank you. Thanks for the encouragement. Way to help out!",
      "Sheppard was broadcasting from somewhere in the vicinity of this system.",
      "Let me see if I can expand the range a little.",
      "I'm getting a contact. Huh. It's a jumper. One life sign.",
      "No, there's something you're not telling us\u2026She was hot, wasn't she?",
      "Well, it's a new symptom. I thought it might be important.",
      "Doctor Baxter? That's his name, right? The\u2026guy on your team\u2026? Katie?",
      "I don't know. We gotta get out there and find out.",
      "Hold on. This is the place. This is where it happened!",
      "If we hadn't deactivated the attack code, this never would've happened.",
      "Hold on, something's happening. The hives are firing on each other.",
      "When we activated them in Weir, she was healed almost instantly.",
      "We'd have him on the run. He'd be finished\u2026Look, if Michael\u2026",
      "Well, not right now, but we can't fire while we're cloaked.",
      "All right. This won't take more than a couple of seconds.",
      "Looks like Michael's got his hyperdrive back online. It's powering up.",
      "This doesn't happen this quick. No one has babies this quick!",
      "(delighted) I caught it. It didn't hit the floor or anything.",
      "Did we keep detailed records? Who are you talking to here?",
      "Doesn't that bother you? I mean, no vindication, no recognition, no\u2026credit?",
      "(annoyed) You could have told me that before I touched it!",
      "Yeah, or just\u2026leave them to die in the vastness of space.",
      "They're still unforeseen. For now, it's working, and we're still alive.",
      "I have to pull the right one, or the antenna explodes.",
      "One step ahead of you. It's not going to happen again.",
      "Remind me to bring a sherpa the next time I visit.",
      "Yeah, because it's stupid! What would've happened if you were wrong?",
      "(drily) Well, I guess we can rule out getting her vote.",
      "So we were right all along; this whole thing is fixed!",
      "Scooter? That is a tri-cell lipo pack under my hood, son.",
      "I don't know, but we should, uh, stop until I do.",
      "(into radio, excited) That's great. Can you shut down the self-destruct?",
      "Good. I'm heading back. Go ahead and reboot the city's power.",
      "You realize it's highly unlikely you're actually going to find anything.",
      "Alrighty. Here we are, all fixed up and ready to roll.",
      "Well, it's hard to explain. I mean my\u2026field is very competitive.",
      "(to Keller) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't let him do this.",
      "Look, these bridges to other space times can be very unpredictable.",
      "He was about to start the thing up! It couldn't wait.",
      "(uncomfortable) Now, look, I can see, how\u2026out of\u2026context\u2026that could seem incriminating.",
      "(ignoring Kramer) That was my work, Malcolm. I wrote that paper.",
      "So this thing could be wreaking havoc all over the facility.",
      "Watch who you're correcting, \"Science Guy\". My PhD is not honorary.",
      "I think I'm onto something. I\u2026it just needs some ironing out.",
      "(inspired) No, no, no, no. This might be a good thing.",
      "(caustic) Well, we're gonna get below freezing pretty darn quick now.",
      "(into radio) Please tell me you got through to the SGC?",
      "Look, this device is capable of generating its own power, right?",
      "(to Malcolm) Tunney, what's the deal? I thought you sent security.",
      "Oh\u2026I don't know what I would've done if I lost you.",
      "(puzzled) Nothing. From what I can tell, they're just sitting here.",
      "It's nothing\u2026just a random bunch of\u2026 (snapping fingers) Wait a second.",
      "(over radio) Sheppard. You're going to want to get up here.",
      "(relieved) Oh, thank god. Then I take it the bulkhead held?",
      "Maybe we should leave. You know, let her get some rest.",
      "Well, you can argue all you want, I'm not letting you\u2014",
      "Ah, my first question as well. Then I remembered Janus's lab\u2026.",
      "(disgusted) And we'll be stuck with this\u2026other woman in Keller's body?",
      "Based on your description and the video surveillance from the casino.",
      "(worried) They could be in a lot of trouble right now.",
      "Okay, look\u2026don't you worry, okay? We're-we're going to get you out.",
      "I suppose it was Zelenka's idea to shut off the power?",
      "Well, we can use the transporter to get them close, but\u2014",
      "All right, getting readings now. It's a hive, all right. Hmm.",
      "I'm reading\u2026a higher than normal energy output. I mean, significantly higher.",

      "(also worried) Standard Wraith procedure. Keep your victims from dialing out.",
      "(smugly) you think we've got a ghost on board or something?",
      "That's because they are us. The alternate reality versions of us.",
      "Well, there's a certain, um,\u2026elegance to the design that I recognize.",
      "(nervous, over radio) What the hell was that? Was it gunfire?",
      "All right, I got it. I got it! Drop the shields.",
      "(worried) Uh, you may want to hold off on the congratulations.",
      "(over radio) That's it, sub-lights are gone for good this time!",
      "(surprised) Uh, it's pretty bad, but, you know, it's better, thanks.",
      "Well, what do you expect? It was trying to kill me!",
      "That's displacement current. High voltage. Do not let it hit you!",
      "Well, I-I'll try but the radio communications were affected as well.",
      "We ran a battery of tests. The jumper's in perfect condition.",
      "Now, the other you, the\u2014human one? She thought you'd been destroyed.",

      "Yeah, but pretty soon, I won't even know who you are!",
      "All right, well let me have a little ham. We'll uh\u2026",
      "She's already too convincing if you ask me. Creeps me out.",

      "Yeah. Maybe there's something in here about how to\u2014 No!",
      "Yeah, well, the things we're seeing are pretty damn identical!",

      "Interesting. Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.",

      "Well, now we know how the Ancients must have felt.",
      "Can't think of a better way of spending the afternoon.",

      "There's no sign of any settlements, at least nothing recent.",
      "It's funny\u2014I was about to make the exact same comment.",
      "Well, it's the old low-tech versus high-tech argument, I suppose.",
      "(grabbing it) Oh\u2026give me that. Where did that come from?",
      "Two minutes! Hold them that long, we're good to go.",
      "Yeah, but I won't send you to one of those.",
      "Well, we know they're not perfect, because they're all dead.",
      "That's heavy. So, I need that over there. Thank you.",

      "And exactly how is he going to do that, huh?",
      "Yeah, well, enjoy the ride, Colonel. They're making me walk.",

      "I mean \"not possible\". What do you think I mean?",
      "No-no-no-no-no-no, we can't leave them here. They know too much.",

      "Believe me, I find this as disturbing as you do.",
      "Aw, forget it. Look this is never going to work.",
      "(voiceover) You can control everything. Proper sanitation systems, water delivery.",
      "Huh. And active. It's transmitting a tremendous amount of data.",
      "No\u2026no. Uh-uh, well\u2026we thought it was a game, but, uh\u2026",
      "Well, then you're also aware that people will get hurt.",
      "(over radio, nervous) Are you watching what's going on here?",
      "(into radio, impatient) Your army is still on the march!",
      "So I gotta get Nola to call off the attack.",

      "(straining with effort) Busy working right now. Call back later.",
      "Hey, it's your day off. What are you doing here?",
      "Yeah, I need, um, an excuse to break those plans.",
      "I told Katie I would spend the day with her.",
      "Yes, well\u2026it was a-a little weird there for a bit.",
      "(over radio) You're all going to want to see this.",
      "Okay, look, this is all very brave and all, but\u2014",
      "It was, um\u2026it was awful. Your family was amazing, though.",
      "(absently) Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to the team.",
      "Huh. Wonder if that means I hired the wrong guy.",
      "Well, no, but we probably could if we wanted to.",
      "There. All of these lifesigns have been accounted for. Humored?",
      "(into radio) It's an auxiliary control area, search grid six.",
      "I should have listened to Teyla. This wouldn't have happened.",
      "(interrupting) Is deadly to humans, but she's not human, remember?",
      "Except for our armless friend. He's still on the move.",
      "Well, maybe. That, or-or part of this settlement is shielded.",
      "I don't know. It's not showing me anything. It's useless.",
      "We've probably just entered the shielded section of the settlement.",
      "That's weird. A bunch of secondary systems just came online.",
      "Engines are off-line! We're venting atmosphere! Power's about to fail!",
      "Ah. I took the liberty of searching his room. Hmm?",
      "You are a scoundrel, you know? That's what you are.",
      "Okay, maybe it's not always obvious to everyone, but, um\u2026",

      "(chuckling with false humility) Fortunately, I'm very good with complexity.",
      "Oh, no, no. I can't think on an empty stomach!",
      "More importantly, why are we just picking them up now?!",
      "Well, there's gotta be a way to know for sure.",
      "(nonplussed) Well, I don't know. That's why I said \"momentarily\".",
      "(holding in his irritation) Please. Of course it will work.",
      "Exactly. So, that's what we'll get them to do now.",
      "None of us are saying what we're all thinking here.",
      "(jealous) Aw, and she said it just came to her?",
      "Oh, good. Because she would just\u2026wait a minute. Why not?",
      "Ah! Can't tell you. Not until you sign the agreement.",
      "Jeanie, please! I'm on it. We are holding at\u2026five percent.",
      "Well, that just doesn't mean he has to stay here!",
      "What does Elizabeth have to say about all of this?",
      "The readings are stronger. Whatever it is? We're getting warmer.",
      "Well, this is it. Ground zero for the energy readings.",
      "What? No. We can't leave. Look, the generator's still running.",
      "Carson! Look, didn't you hear me? I've been calling you!",
      "(into radio) All right, that means we'll need to uh\u2014",
      "Okay. Okay, well, I'll give you the, uh, Cole's Notes.",
      "It's gonna collapse the shield. It's trying to save power.",
      "I can. I just\u2014I need some time. If you, uh\u2026",
      "Heh, it'll be a breeze\u2026with the exception of the micro-asteroids.",

      "(over radio) Yeah, I heard you. We're on our way.",
      "Both ships at the same time. This is a first.",
      "Well, \"essentially neutralized\" and \"neutralized\" are two very different things.",
      "Well, there you go. See, I work best under pressure.",
      "Evidently, they haven't figured out how we're tracking them, and\u2014",
      "Well, I'm just, um, dotting some \"i's\", crossing some \"t's\"\u2026",
      "Yeah, but you're talking about neutron star levels of density.",
      "In that case, there's only one thing we can do.",
      "Well, I know, it's just that you're\u2026you're gonna\u2026cease to be.",

      "No, I'm picking up residual radiation from Wraith weapons' fire.",
      "Still picking up the Wraith tracking device. It's that way.",
      "Yeah. I'm picking up an energy reading on the surface.",
      "I'm patched into the Wraith console. I've got internal schematics\u2026.whoa!",
      "Oh great. My entire life, I've never been chosen first.",
      "(shaken) Well, I think that should probably do the trick.",
      "Yeah, or, uh, drown my sorrows should she say no.",
      "I don't know. I feel a little dizzy\u2026a little feverish.",
      "Hey. You look like you could use some cheering up.",
      "And I imagine she's as, uh, beautiful as you two?",
      "Well, yes he is, 'cause I'm going to tell him.",
      "The second you were gone, she went into your bag!",
      "But you know who they are. Are you trading partners?",
      "Oh, that sneaky little\u2026I told you we should've stunned her!",
      "Sorry, I'm hungry. And when I'm hungry, I get cranky.",
      "Yeah, well he will, so don't get your hopes up.",
      "(squirming) No, that's not true. I\u2026I don't not like you.",
      "If we don't respond, they're going to come and investigate.",
      "(calling to Sheppard) You know, you're not exactly inspiring confidence.",
      "(triumphant) Son of a bitch! I think I got it!",
      "Well, it was powered up. Fifty-fifty chance it's still operational.",
      "I would never move if that was the case. Ah.",
      "Okay, just a sec\u2014the ceiling is like, what, twenty feet?",
      "Carrell\u2026but I would pick Jon Stewart over both of them.",

      "(to Keller) Hey, if you got an idea, feel free.",
      "Okay, I'm sorry. What I mean is-is that you have\u2014",
      "(shivering) No. Used everything I got to get this far.",
      "(defensively) There was no time! I would've figured it out.",
      "Eh, it's probably just a glitch, a simple software hiccup.",
      "The MALP is through. Receiving telemetry. Visual coming in now.",
      "(worried) That's Wraith tech. It's hooked up to the DHD!",
      "Well, connect to the bridge via another 'gate in Pegasus.",

      "No surprise there. I'm sure Michael got rid of that.",
      "(panicking, into radio) Okay, look. Uh\u2026try plugging it in again.",
      "Well, there's still the small matter of landing this thing.",

      "(frantic) Can you make it back to the 'gate? Sheppard?!",
      "All right, close enough to do a full sensor sweep.",
      "(turning on his computer) What about her? Was she there?",
      "It started suddenly, and then it just\u2026uh, it just stopped.",
      "Nothing. It was just\u2026empty hallways. How did I get here?",
      "And what happens when we all start losing our memory?",
      "I don't know. Looks like they left in a hurry.",
      "I've been looking into that, and it's not very promising.",
      "(smugly) If I have the original virus? Not a problem.",
      "Have the kidnappers tried to make contact with us yet?",
      "Yeah, me too. Any idea who's behind any of this?",
      "Well, I memorized the building's layout from this computer here.",
      "(scared, but determined) I want him to feed on me.",
      "Yeah, well, we'll talk about it on the way home.",
      "(nervously) Okay! No bad guys. Just got to\u2026just sit tight.",
      "Well, like, fifteen minutes is not a lot of time.",
      "But I'm not an M.D.! I've never been an M.D.!",
      "(taking the remote) Let me see. Did you break it?",
      "I just delivered a baby! That's not enough for today?",
      "(absently) Good luck. (stopping short) What do you mean \"us\"?",
      "At least we know why they brought us with them.",
      "They're going to kill you! We don't have a choice.",
      "Well, all of the Stargates in the Pegasus network, yes.",
      "Oh my god, please don't kill me. You need me!",
      "You know, we both don't have to go in there.",
      "I'm pretty sure we want to avoid those touching us.",
      "I did\u2026uh, we did\u2026you did. Look, where does it hurt?",
      "You don't think they'd-they'd make a run at us again?",
      "Yeah, I heard. They're, um, sending you back to Earth.",
      "Are you sure? You got one of those\u2026 \"Beckett\" faces.",
      "Oh, I knew it. You found something. What is it?",
      "I'm not wandering aimlessly. I'm exploring. There's a big difference.",
      "Yeah, come on, Carson. You can do this, all right?",
      "(stammering) Me? No. I-um, I don't have time for that.",
      "(mocking) Oh, I'm sorry. Too fast for you, buddy boy?",
      "(incredulous) Hey, what're you\u2026how'd you get up here so fast?",
      "I know, and I was getting to it, I swear.",
      "Look, just\u2014what about the gate shield? Can you lower it?",
      "(into walkie talkie) What about the self-destruct? Is it disabled?",
      "I'm always deep in thought. It keeps me sharp. And\u2026sleepless.",
      "Well, you\u2026you want to go to this thing with me?",
      "(defensively) Oh. You're just lucky the lady's here, aren't you?",
      "Hmm, possibly. I mean I\u2026I used to be a little\u2026abrasive?",
      "Ah-hah. Well, I'm guessing that that word is, \"I apologize.\"",
      "I don't know yet. Have you turned up the heat?",
      "I don't suppose you have access to the communications room?",
      "(slowly) Because that could create a tear in our space-time?",
      "(innocently) Well, don't look at me. It was his idea.",
      "Hey look, I just need to keep doing what I\u2014",
      "Yeah, something fast, because the containment field's about to fail.",
      "(into radio) Have they got you out of there yet?",
      "(puzzled) I don't know. It's like the file's corrupted somehow.",
      "They should be. I mean, there's no reason why they\u2014",
      "Well, I was right. They're all in their hibernation pods.",
      "(annoyed) Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you!",
      "No, it's no good. I can't access it from here.",
      "Hey. What's wrong? You seem distracted. Is something bothering you?",
      "(protesting) A few hours?! You could've told us that before!",
      "They won't know you. You're in Jennifer Keller's body, remember?",
      "This one fancies himself a bit of a poet\u2026not good.",
      "Yes! It would require more energy than he has now.",
      "(to others) He thinks he's found him! (into phone) How?",
      "(to Harriman) Harriman, he's going to tap into the grid.",
      "(worried) It's a transmission\u2026coded in Wraith. I'm working on it.",
      "(sarcastic) Fine, well then we'll just keep them there forever.",
      "It doesn't matter, okay? We're gonna fix this. I promise.",
      "He just got there. Look, I'm tapped into their intercom.",
      "Well, for one thing, they don't exactly grow on trees.",
      "Of course not. They must just be running a test\u2026",
      "(caustic) Let me guess, something to do with the ZPM?",
      "(grinning) That-that is a good sign! That's a good sign!",
      "(piqued) Oh sure, I just have to get to engineering.",
      "I'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.",
      "No. According to our instruments, we haven't moved at all.",
      "I think we're looking at a new kind of drive.",
      "We didn't. At least, according to the ship's navigational systems.",
      "Wha-you don't think the other us would've already tried that?",
      "(high-pitched) No! It's completely shot! I already told you that!",
      "A flying monkey? What is this? The planet of Oz?",
      "(frustrated) I could if I knew what the problem was.",
      "Okay, I got bad news, and I got good news.",
      "Still online, plenty of power. It's just suddenly become, um\u2026",
      "(more cautious) It's one of several possibilities we're looking into.",
      "And we saw what kind of damage one can do.",
      "Almost done. They're just, uh, finishing up the last one.",

      "No, I am. I can feel it. This is amazing!",

      "Well I think we can all agree that that would be bad, yes.",

      "When I said I was almost finished, I-I guess I wasn't kidding.",

      "Anyone with a basic understanding of body language could've told you that.",

      "We're not really, are we? You held back some of the virus.",
      "I got ambushed trying to track down the guys who took you.",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you captured?! How do you figure that?",
      "What are you talking about? I have an excellent sense of direction.",
      "You're going to kill us either way. What exactly is our incentive?",
      "(in panicked whisper to Jeanie) We need to get out of here.",
      "Okay, okay, the first thing we got to do is make sure\u2014",
      "Well, as embarrassing as I find this to say\u2026I need some help.",
      "(fiercely) This is a matter of life and death! Open the door!",
      "Say\u2026you and I are about even when it comes to looks, right?",
      "Yeah, in the short term, but if we get out of here\u2026?",
      "(annoyed) No, no. You shut up, this is important! If Michael is\u2014",
      "It is just a matter of time before the hybrids reach them.",
      "(wincing in pain) Okay, there, there. There. There they are. There there.",
      "Yeah, okay, so\u2026okay. Teyla, I'd like to introduce you to your son.",
      "Going to see Teyla. Oh, you probably heard. I delivered her baby.",
      "Well, it-it's not clear. But, that's the key to the whole shebang.",
      "(chuckling, pleased) No. Everything's in the green. I mean, it's working great.",
      "I mean, they need me. You're kinda expendable. I just figured that\u2014",
      "What do you think? We're looking for a way off the ship.",
      "Yeah, I pulled up a schematic of the ship on that console.",
      "Come to think of it, what are you doing down here anyway?",
      "(contrite) Yeah, well, you know, we're done here. We're just\u2026you know\u2026finishing up.",
      "Everything's dead. There's no way of knowing what the hell's going on!",
      "Yeah. Well, maybe the-the door was already closed when we lost power.",
      "(into walkie) Yeah, well, let me know when you've got one online.",
      "(worried) That's Atlantis's self destruct. Michael's going to blow up the city!",

      "(into radio) Yeah, I did it when I first got here. Why?",
      "Well, the power fluctuations. They must be more widespread than I thought.",
      "I think it's more than likely. It's probably going to get worse.",
      "It's one of the hibernation chambers. It's not accepting the new command.",

      "Not necessarily. We've developed a gene therapy that works\u2026some of the time.",
      "It worked. They just sent Ronon in to give her the shot.",
      "We're not even close. We're on the edge of the Milky Way.",

      "(into radio) Something's happening. The energy reading. It's going off the charts!",
      "Well, admittedly, there are problems, but it is still a monumental achievement.",
      "That\u2026was the good news. The bad news, is we lost life support.",
      "We've got power disruptions all over the city. Nearly every system's affected.",
      "I don't know. I've had some pretty horrendous migraines in my time\u2014",
      "Well, she can't stay where she is. She's frying the city's computers.",
      "Oh, no. They just engaged the ZPM. Energy levels are rising rapidly.",
      "Not that this is exactly the dinner I had in mind, but\u2026",
      "Would someone please tell me what the hell we're all doing here?",
      "We've been trying to do that for four years. They're still here!",
      "I can't. I've had, like, three cups of coffee. I'm completely wired.",
      "They must've lost some of their weapons. I mean, they're seriously outgunned.",
      "Well, at least the tracks are clear, though. Easier to follow, right?",
      "Looks like we're not the only ones who noticed his signal died.",
      "Yes, well of course I do. That's why I was asking you."

      "What? You're saying you think Teyla might be able to\u2026tap into this Wraith psychic network?",
      "Yes, yes, yes. The point is, we think we can use it to our advantage.",
      "I don't think Tylenol's going to do it. He needs a doctor. How much longer?",
      "Oh, I apologize for being the only person who truly comprehends how screwed we are!",

      "Look, I have a purpose here, okay? You deal with them. Excuse me. Thank you.",
      "Which is how I'm able to speak with you, yes. Do you have a second?",
      "Yes, they are. The EM shield is what's keeping the Wraith away, not the sacrificing.",
      "Okay, you can have this\u2026 but you've got to promise to let me work, okay?",
      "Hey, you guys okay? All right, head back to the woods. You're gonna be fine.",
      "Wait. The energy readings here are exactly the same as they were a mile away.",
      "I've run a diagnostic on the ZPM. These are the results I keep getting back.",
      "Elizabeth, how did you expect them to react when you told them about the Wraith?",

      "Made all the more frightening by the fact that you think it's a good plan.",

      "Yeah, which is why I've installed an interface to translate a lot of the readouts.",
      "What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine? Look, just give me the damn crystals.",
      "Why, so you can kill me in private? Stab another knife in my back, huh?",

      "We were trying to trace the source of the power spike that killed Dr. Monroe.",

      "Hey, I can eat frozen dinners without thawing them, and sometimes it even affects me.",
      "I want you to pull the crystal. Pull it when I say go, all right?",
      "But we won't know for sure until we go back down there and try again.",
      "You need to avoid flying in predictable trajectories to prevent the weapon locking onto us.",
      "Can I just say there's no way the Jumper can take even one direct hit?",
      "Look, is there anywhere that she likes to go\u2014any favorite hiding spots or favorite places?",
      "No, bigger. Some sort of a scout ship, probably after the same thing we are.",
      "Well, reviving them\u2019s out of the question. The pod\u2019s the only thing keeping them alive.",
      "Well, I've never thought of it that way, but\u2026 Hey, she's right. You should go.",
      "Well, did you mention that that's impossible, given that they're living in a virtual environment?",

      "They were studying the whales' language, trying to assign frequencies to emotions and identify moods.",
      "Yeah, we can't gate to Earth. Look, we need the ZPM's power for the shields.",

      "Well, they retreated without any kind of a fight. What kind of army is that?",
      "See, we were beamed up earlier to our ship, the Daedalus, in\u2026orbit over your planet.",
      "Mmm, more like centuries. I mean, there's nothing down there but ruins and plant life.",
      "Unfortunately, the computer froze. It was completely locked up. You probably should've used a Mac.",
      "Oh\u2026which is to say, you know, you need time off, just-just like everyone else does.",
      "And it's still early, so I'm sure you'll find someone else to go with you.",
      "And besides it's still early. I'm sure you'll find someone else to go with you.",

      "(over radio) Sheppard, the creatures are closing in on you fast. You better get moving.",
      "Two days. Well, we could, uh, well, you could beat them there in the Daedalus.",
      "(concerned) True. But I didn't do it. It's like they just woke up by themselves.",
      "(low, to team) Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs, and\u2026get out of here.",
      "(distracted) Eh, it probably wouldn't hurt to, uh, make contact with the locals though, no?",
      "Then again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicines.",
      "Aw, now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the jumper.",
      "We drop out of hyperspace; we beam him on board; we get out of there.",
      "Okay, fine, so like a few seconds for it to build up power, but not\u2026",
      "(annoyed) Again. There is nothing more annoying than people who won't admit their own mistakes.",
      "Okay! We think we've found a way to uncouple the nanite cells from Elizabeth's cells.",
      "Uh, reality check? There are microscopic robots in her brain! How does she fight that?",
      "We'll rephrase that, too. We would like him to be able to speak to us.",
      "Uh\u2026I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye\u2026I just-uh-you know\u2026I reacted.",
      "Um\u2026a mouse. A really big one though. Uh, more of a rat really, possibly rabid.",
      "(incredulous) What debt?! Are you kidding? I mean, he looks younger than he did before!",
      "No, he would've wanted us working together, side by side, toppling problems, and-and sharing credit.",
      "This is important, Jeanie. I mean, it's much more important than you could ever imagine.",
      "(annoyed) Yes, we try not to encourage him. He's got a bit of an ego.",
      "It could travel almost instantaneously. I mean, your universe could just flash out of existence!",
      "Mmm. Well, aside from itchy\u2026and the\u2026overpowering urge to eat an entire loaf of white bread.",
      "Okay, you're right. You're right. (into radio) Uh, Zelenka, we need to deploy some teams.",
      "Well, it would be great if they were working, but sub-light and navigation are out.",
      "Okay, I know what you're thinking, but helping Elizabeth is not putting us at risk!",
      "Uh\u2026I'll be right back. I just remembered I forgot to unplug something\u2026or-or plug it in.",
      "Well, I'm going to need more than that. I'm gonna need disinfectant, or some stitches\u2014",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. We've got a problem. The cells aren't communicating properly.",
      "Yeah, well, I'm sorry. But the block idea didn't fly. This was the only way.",
      "Now, while I'm working in the core room, we'll beam Fran down to the city.",
      "As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.",
      "(studying displays) Oh, she's not kidding. According to this, navigation, propulsion, and communications are online.",
      "(whispering fiercely) You want a different exit? It was hard enough to find this one!",
      "Yeah, eighth of a carat, actually. Conflict-free and um, I got a good deal, actually.",
      "Well, will you give it to me later when you decide not to eat it?",
      "What about you, huh? When you're queen, are you going to start trade back up?",
      "I'm sure you did, but she is thirteen, she's unreasonable, among many other awful attributes.",
      "(insulted) No, I'm a\u2014 (takes a deep breath and calms down) What do you want?",
      "One hundred percent chance they'll kill us if we talk about it for much longer.",
      "I was once a ten year old boy too. I know what gets their attention.",
      "We have to seal the bottom of the tube around the gas leak, like so\u2026",
      "M6R-125. We could connect the bridge through that, but I'd need to reconfigure the macros.",
      "Well, not really, but even if we did, we'd have no way of finding him.",
      "Yes, yeah, I just\u2014. Well, we need you to fill in some of the details.",
      "(panicking) What? Wait. No-no-no-no-no. Not right now. Look, I haven't finished finalizing the power distrib\u2014",
      "Wait a minute. If I'm not there, how are we supposed to input the command?",
      "That's a Wraith planet. The attack command must have been activated. Whaddya know, it worked.",
      "(over radio) Look, I need you to describe exactly what you're seeing. Where are you?",
      "(over radio) Heh, it's connected to an independent power source. Don't worry, it will work.",
      "(intrigued) I know. It is kind of cool when you think about it, isn't it.",
      "The solution. To everything. Well, you. This. All of this! I mean, Atlantis, Pegasus, Michael\u2026everything!",
      "You know, we've taken out entire hive ships, okay? Compared to us, you are amateurs.",
      "(groaning) Oh, not really. Ronon's buddies are the reason we're here; they set us up.",
      "But, uh, you said, no more 'gate travel. I-I thought that was a wise decision.",
      "It's demonstrated some, uh, pretty sophisticated intelligence so far. It could have basic avoidance skills.",
      "Oh boy. Nice whale. Nice whale. You're my friend. You don't want to eat me.",
      "Oh God\u2026I have to get back. I have to get back. That's my only chance.",
      "Of course not. No one reaches anywhere near that level of advancement without being culled.",
      "Well, the logical assumption is that he's on board the ship that transmitted the signal.",
      "Well, I heard you were back, and I hadn't seen you for a while, so\u2026",
      "(gasping) They just destroyed each other. I guess the other Wraith didn't buy their story.",
      "Well, before Sheppard's Wraith showed up, I was trying to perfect my nanite medical program.",
      "It's too late, we're almost there. I'll give you an address. You can meet us.",
      "Technically, her brain is perfectly healthy. It's-it's like she's been\u2026reset to zero, so to speak.",
      "We need to get Jeanie to the SGC immediately. Is the Daedalus still in orbit?",
      "(unenthusiastic) Oh, sure, sure. Whaddya got planned? An exciting exploration of insignificant Ancient historical events?",
      "They're lights that fell to the ground during a flood. It's not like they're gonna\u2014",
      "(relaxing) Too true. So, I guess none of us signed up to get famous, huh?",
      "Good one. (sobering) Wait a minute\u2014you don't get paid more than I do, do you?",
      "(sarcastic) Oh, great. It's sealed shut, and they've removed the door control from this side.",
      "Okay, uh, we go to the, uh, power relay station; we create a massive explosion.",
      "(continuing) \u2026more than we would've liked. But who's to say we didn't deserve it, right?",
      "(inspired) Wait a second\u2026these suits were designed to protect the wearer from harsh environments, right?",
      "(caustically) \"A hop, skip, and a jump from the 'gate?\" That's what you call that?",
      "So\u2026how's life in the wilds of Pegasus? You got to be missing Atlantis by now.",
      "Oh, thank god! Okay, we are on the hive ship. I've got Beckett with me.",
      "What other choice do we have? I mean, we know we can't win this thing.",
      "As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.",
      "I must have put too much strain on the motor. Shaft needs a bushing lube.",
      "(puzzled) That's strange. Lights are all out all over the city except the control room.",
      "(into radio) This is Dr. Rodney McKay calling anyone in the control room. Please respond.",
      "Yeah, but not much else. I mean, the drive pods won't extend. There's no drones.",
      "Well, if I can get them working at all, a lot more than ten minutes!",
      "(smug) Well, he can rest easy now, cause, uh, Michael's finally out of the picture.",
      "There you go. He just prefers to be on his own. Speaking of which\u2026where's Sheppard?",
      "According to this, the device is emitting a low-level energy signature in an oscillating pattern.",
      "Thanks! Well, pull up a chair, Radek. We've got some work to do. All right\u2026",
      "I'm not getting anywhere with that. I mean, despite the fact that I am\u2026a genius.",
      "The modulated ultra-low frequency emanating from the device. I've seen something like this before\u2026Oh, no.",
      "Lieutenant Donovan had a nasty reaction to something he ate? They came back early\u2026didn't they?",
      "(hopefully) Well, there'll be drinks probably, and maybe those little sandwiches? And\u2026me! I'll be there.",
      "(drily) Well, it has been great running into you guys. We should\u2026maybe get our seats.",
      "The heat-sink reacts by drawing power from a single localized place inside the containment field.",
      "What, are you worried about all the money you sunk into this? 'Cause that's gone!",
      "We just need to give it a little more time. Just a little more time\u2026",
      "Yeah, but we were almost there. It was peaking out! It was going to work.",
      "Look, that cloak offers us no protection whatsoever. If that hive opens up on us\u2014-",
      "(intrigued) Well, it's encrypted. Using the same kind of algorithm we use on the Daedalus.",
      "No, there's too much data missing. That is as good as we're going to get.",
      "Where the hell did that wall come from? That wasn't there when we came in!",
      "All right, this is it. Through here, about a hundred meters, then we are there.",
      "Well, it's one of the smaller auxiliary chambers, so\u2026a-a couple of dozen at the most?",
      "Who, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just want to check your earwig. Here we go.",
      "(into radio) Just a second. (handing radio to Neeva) It's for you. Working fine, apparently.",
      "Look, I never said it wasn't dangerous. It could open up any number of anomalies.",
      "I know. It looks like the device tore a small hole in the space-time continuum.",
      "(low, to Sheppard) Do you want to, uh, go over the plan one more time?",
      "It's the principle of the thing. Everyone else gets to hold him, why shouldn't I?",
      "I don't understand it! We always jump to the same relative position in space! Unless\u2026",
      "All right, the first thing I need you to do is head down to engineering.",
      "(over radio) Dammit. That didn't buy us nearly as much power as I would've thought.",

      "We don't know for sure that they're runners\u2026.but I'll bet anything, that one's Ronon.",
      "Yeah, more than that, he saved my life. He's like a brother to me.",
      "Why would they say they had a plan if they don't have a plan?",
      "(dryly) I'm sorry, but all your credibility was lost when you locked us up.",
      "It doesn't matter. I'm counting seven ships. There's nothing they could do about it.",
      "Metaphysical debates aside, what do you want from us? We're not exactly ascension experts.",
      "(abashed) Oh, just things that Sheppard would say, so I just thought I would\u2014",
      "Mmm, yes. She hasn't published a single theoretical physics paper in, like, four years.",

      "Okay, you've just been teleported to an interstellar vessel in orbit above the planet.",
      "A slight problem. It was the creation of exotic particles in the containment field.",
      "Okay, you've got a nota bene by the cosmological constant. Why is that? Jeanie?",
      "According to these readings, if we shut it down now, he won't make it!",
      "Well, it's hard to say, really, but, uh, I doubt he'll be back, though.",
      "Actually, very little. Look, I can only surmise that it's some sort of Wraith\u2026experiment.",
      "Well, I can now state for certain that it is in fact a generator.",
      "Besides, look, I've been working inside the generator which is probably, uh, shielded somehow\u2026",

      "Are you listening? Look, I said I can reprogram them to be completely harmless.",
      "I've got something. It's another life sign. It's the outer edge of the city.",
      "Well, that's not so bad. I guess the Wraith have really taken a toll.",

      "No, \"great\" is a beach with a fiber-optic hook-up. This, this is complete agony!",

      "Right. Right, so\u2026 Wait a minute, doesn't that make me a really bad person?",
      "Allow me to make a prediction. This will be a complete waste of time.",
      "I suppose the most obvious solution is to shut down the attack code again.",
      "Well, that was easy. Well, actually, it was spectacularly difficult, but then, everything's relative.",
      "They're still just talking. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. We got problem.",

      "Good, because explosive decompression and death by suffocation with that thing on my face is possibly the\u2014",
      "That would make it approximately the size of, uh\u2026 I have no idea, but it sounds huge.",
      "Whoa, wait. I just realized something. You're saying that our unconscious bodies are still on the planet.",
      "If we switch to the cloak before the blast radius diminishes, we'll all be incinerated. Five seconds.",
      "(screaming) No, I will not settle down! I have been drugged against my will, you little punk!",
      "Even if I could, I wouldn't. I'm sorry. Drug me all you want. I'm not doing this.",
      "Please, just give me a little enzyme, just enough to take the edge off. I'm dying here.",
      "I don't know, exactly, but I think I can figure it out. I told you Ford's alive.",
      "Uh, Colonel, with all due respect, some of those people could be extremely helpful in the investigation.",
      "Look, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence. It can think for itself, adapt itself to new situations\u2026",
      "(into radio) All systems are functioning normally. No sign of the virus. Looks like it worked, Colonel.",
      "Right. Quick question, though, just out of curiosity. How much, uh, like, air do these things carry?",
      "(calling after Sheppard) Or the perfect place to be exposed to dangerously high levels of solar radiation!",
      "(frantically) Mayday! Mayday! We are under attack. Lorne's been hit. I repeat, we are under Wraith attack!",
      "Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, but everything's fine now. It's all been sorted out. Back to normal.",
      "(as Cadman) Well, I've canceled on her so many times. I don't want to mess this up.",
      "Oh, my God, he's tasting it! You don't know what that is. That could be their laundry!",
      "Hmm. Really. I wonder if there's ever been a convicted felon who didn't claim he was innocent?",
      "What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No! We've got a big problem in here!",
      "(working on console) Almost\u2026just give me one more\u2026and\u2026okay! We're armed! Go, before the power cuts out again!",
      "Well, the database is over ten thousand years old. You can bet things have changed around here.",
      "Everything's fine. The containment bottle was designed to automatically compensate for any sudden changes in energy output.",
      "Okay, we have been over this. I am doing this manually, at half power. It's a cakewalk.",
      "And as long as I'm monitoring the energy output manually, I can stop that before it happens.",
      "No, no, no! You people need to go back to the village! It is not safe here.",
      "Not entirely suspended, however. The pod has slowed their aging considerably, but the bodies are virtually moribund.",
      "The Wraith we found was male. The First Officer must have been female. It took her place.",
      "Because if it's our guys, then our chances of survival just went back above zero, albeit fractionally.",
      "I'm detecting a foreign object travelling at .999 the speed of light, and it's coming this way.",
      "(sighing again) Hey, at least you still get to go off-world with a team of your own.",
      "Okay, I'll start broadcasting the virus now, but, uh, we're gonna need to get closer than that.",
      "Okay, closing the outer door. Yes. Now, I just have to pressurize the compartment and we are\u2026",
      "Let's just say that we're concerned the Daedalus won't be able to carry out your standing orders.",
      "I know, I'm being unusually persistent about this, but, uh, that should only underscore its importance, yes?",
      "They're not trying to kill us. It's quite the opposite. I think they're trying to help us.",
      "Temperature inside the shield's rising too fast. And I'm already detecting several failed sensors on the bow.",
      "Wh-wh-wh-wait. Am I the only person here who thinks he is taking advantage of these poor people.",
      "You're damn right I do! Look, it can come in extremely handy. Look, he's practically wasting it!",
      "(between mouthfuls) Eh, if they haven't found him yet, chances are he managed to slip the perimeter.",
      "She used to leave the lights on, all over the house. Every room. Drove my father nuts.",
      "Are you insane?! Look, I need to be put under guard. Who knows what I could become!",
      "You know, while we're at it, my knees are killing me. How does anyone relax like this?",
      "Oh god, there's so many things. Not talking happens to be one of them, by the way.",
      "I just thought of a brilliant adjunct to the chaos theory! Look, I should write this down!",
      "Ah. Yes. Well\u2026this will all be over soon, and you can get back to some real work.",
      "(quietly) Good. Well, then, if it's not too much trouble, I'd like you to read my eulogy.",
      "(voiceover) Yeah, it's more about whose society outshines the other's. I mean, who creates a better infrastructure.",
      "Yes, well, uh\u2026this is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, Ronon Dex, and I'm\u2026McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay.",
      "How are you going to deliver it, huh? I mean, the-the catapult couldn't possibly reach that far.",
      "(caustically) Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, we hollowed out a lot of moons back in the sixties.",
      "Looks like the entire bulkhead was twisted when Sammy Suicide decided to fire up his rocket ship.",
      "Look, I know how much you love to think you can fly anything, but it is not\u2014",
      "Yeah, but that'll take half an hour. Look, if he's not done removing it by then, then\u2014",
      "Look, who knows? Teyla\u2019s Spidey sense works for miles. Look, are the external sensors up and running?",
      "(annoyed) And then systematically killed the entire crew, one by one. Thank you for bringing that up.",
      "She's right. We can set up a\u2014 a\u2014what do you call it? A-a-a perimeter. Wait it out.",
      "(into radio) Keep going, straight up the tunnel. Ronon should be coming around the corner towards you\u2026now.",
      "(sarcastic) Oh yeah, fly, shimmy, spin like a top. You didn't think it'd be hard, did you?",
      "Meaning the two hundred prisoners we've got in stasis? Well, we can't keep them in there forever.",

      "(rolling his eyes) Of course. If it sounds like it might be impossible, you look at me.",
      "(scoffing) Well, so do we. Just because they know how to use Ancient technology doesn't mean they're\u2014",
      "Um, sorry. ZPMs. Uh, um, uh a device that taps vast amounts of power from vacuum energy?",
      "Yeah, but even if they deleted every reference to Asura, you'd think there'd be some hint of\u2026",
      "Look, I already told you, it\u2026never mind(snapping at Niam) Need an access code to remove the failsafes.",
      "What? No-no-no. Not yet. We need to be in a jumper, or clear of the city, or-or\u2026",
      "Ah, well, no offense, blue eyes, but, um, I'd like a little more time with it, myself.",
      "Yes, but of course, we would be unable to detect that signal from within the containment chamber.",
      "Yeah, uh, I swiped it from Weir's desk. It's not like there's a Toys-R-Us nearby. So, uh\u2026",
      "Every second I waste, we're draining more power. Just trust me, we're doing the right thing here.",
      "He's conveniently leaving out the reason why those safety protocols are in place in the first place.",
      "Yeah, ideally, somewhere with a few ZPMs to spare. We come back, we get Atlantis fully powered.",
      "(insistently) I know what I saw. It was nanite code a split second before the system crashed.",
      "From there, I should be able to hack into their systems and set the ZPMs to overload.",
      "All right. M7R-227, you were a constant pain in the ass, it's good to see you go.",
      "All right. I would've loved to seen Ellis's face when my plan worked. He's such a tool.",
      "You've seen how big it is. I doubt our C-4's going to make much of a dent.",
      "Ah. Found it. It's coming from down there. Told you. You don't need Ronon while I'm here.",
      "You know, I-I requested to go back with you, but the Ancient device on M7G-677 is malfunctioning.",
      "(piqued) That is private medical information that should not be so cavalierly shared in casual conversation, Doctor.",
      "(rolling his eyes) Oh, really? I was just-just getting used to the idea of not letting go!",
      "I'm telling you they made it to the Midway Station before the malfunction; I'm sure of it.",
      "I have to figure out a safe work-around to avoid any commands that may have been compromised.",
      "I don't know. One thing's for sure, whoever has it knew exactly what they were looking for.",
      "Carson. So sorry I haven't come by before now, it's been\u2026pretty hectic here the last few days.",
      "(annoyed) Was there something else that you needed, or were you here merely to prod and belittle?",
      "She's right. If we don't get hold of a ZPM, this city and everyone in it will\u2014",
      "(over radio) No. I can't communicate with her. I can't track her. It's like she just-just disappeared.",
      "All right, everything checks out. Weapons, shields, long-range sensors, all in the green. She's good to go.",
      "(voiceover) By the time we got back to Earth, well, uh, we weren't just colleagues any more.",
      "No, you can. I can! And I'm going to\u2026even if it takes the rest of my life.",
      "I just want to say that I think the IOA could not have made a better choice.",
      "Well, you know, the unrequited lust that's been hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.",
      "I can't pinpoint the source. The jungle's pretty thick though. It could be hiding just about anything.",
      "I still remember the first time I saw it. I certainly did not think it was cool.",
      "(over comm) Does someone want to get me some coffee? I'm already feeling a little tired here.",
      "(panicking) Why are they doing this to us? Look, why can't anyone remember? My\u2026computer. Where's my computer?",
      "Wrong on both. Otto Preminger was Mister Freeze. Victor Buono was King Tut. Vincent Price was Egghead.",
      "The MALP's detecting residual radiation. The energy signature's consistent with Replicator weapons fire. He's telling the truth.",
      "Jeanie and I were corresponding by e-mail. Um, she was, uh\u2026I was bouncing some ideas off her.",
      "(low) I need to get you back to the SGC. Your nanites are running the same program\u2014",
      "(inspired) Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. The doctor said her heart just stopped, right? Seemingly out of nowhere.",
      "Well, we need to slow down the nanites. Look, this could buy us ten hours, at least.",
      "It's classic Wraith battle technique. They dial the 'gate, lock everyone out, make sure they can't escape.",
      "Okay, I will admit that I may have been a little brusque with you up until now.",
      "All right, uh, just don't\u2014don't panic. Don't panic. I have\u2026got lots of experience escaping from these things.",
      "All over. The electromagnetic radiation this device is giving off covers the entire city and well beyond.",
      "No, no, it makes sense. I mean, every kid with a computer password-protects. Why wouldn't an alien?",
      "What? I\u2026she caught me off-guard. What did you want me to say? What would you have said?",

      "There is no way that he came up with this on his own. We gotta\u2026we gotta\u2026we\u2026come on.",
      "I told you not to turn it on. I practically begged you, but would you listen? No!",
      "(on video) There's got to be something in here I can use to discredit that pretentious tool.",
      "Okay, this little side effect is going to really hamper our attempts to shut this thing down.",
      "Last time I checked, you were claiming to be a genius. I already gave you the plan!",
      "Look, these glitches we've been experiencing, they're not confined to power regulation. They're in every major system.",

      "(over radio) Maybe. I mean, you might be able to get a couple of shots off. Why?",
      "Well, as much as I'd like to say we didn't see that coming, we, you know, did.",
      "Yeah, well, I\u2014I didn't get much sleep the night before. And I did skimp on breakfast, so\u2026",
      "Seriously, the next time we have to name one of these guys, we should take a vote.",
      "We can't stay here, we're stuck on a hive, surrounded by Wraith. Not exactly our strongest position.",

      "Oh, so you're willing to take all of the credit, but none of the blame, huh?",
      "Intergalactic gate network should be complete soon, so um\u2026maybe it won't be four years next time?",
      "Probably. It's be just our luck if we stumbled on one of their nuclear testing sites.",
      "(incredulous) What? Power levels are still rising. No, no, no-no-no-no-no-no. No, that's impossible. Okay\u2026that's not right.",
      "I already told you, Barasso is dead. It's the EM generator. It's messing with your mind.",
      "No, that's good. Well, otherwise we'd lose the shields, we'd lose atmosphere, we'd-we'd all be dead.",
      "Well, maybe not, but you know what, give it some time, you can ask her herself!",
      "If that thing hadn't crashed into the city, who knows how long this could've gone on.",
      "No, I uh, I want to finish this. What about you? Isn't it past your bedtime?",
      "(angry) No, no, I'm just wondering when the Colonel here became a math and physics expert!",
      "(despondent) Oh. I have to tell them. I have to tell them we don't have anything.",
      "Actually, unencumbered by the continual need to explain things to you, I've actually made remarkable progress.",
      "Hmm. The systems the Ancients had in place were designed to create fully-functional humanoid Replicators, right?",
      "I know that it wasn't part of the plan, but it was either this, or nothing.",
      "It noticed that, uh, Zelenka and I both had names, and, um\u2026and she asked for one.",
      "Thank you, Captain Obvious. Of course it's a map. The question is, a map to what?",
      "That's good, isn't it? He'll come back for us. I mean, after all, we saved him.",
      "Uh, could you get her to tell us which way? 'Cause I kinda got turned around.",
      "I feel it's time that, uh, Katie and I moved the relationship to the next level.",
      "(snapping his fingers) All right, I'm gonna need a radio. I left mine in the lab.",
      "Are you sure? 'Cause, uh, oh\u2026my joints ache. It's usually the first sign of a fever.",
      "Oh\u2026see, now you're in trouble. You just wait 'till Sheppard gets back here, 'cause he's gonna\u2014",
      "All right, your highness, I have had just about enough out of you with this whole\u2014",
      "Yeah, well it wouldn't be the first time, and I'm sure it won't be the last.",
      "(indicating the downed Genii) Well, maybe because genius over there was messing with the crystal tray?",
      "Yes, and I'm pretty sure they've been breathing even longer. So again, my problem trumps yours.",
      "(talking over her) It would save us a lot of time in the back and forth.",
      "Okay, well, you gals get started on the, uh, knotting, and, um, I'll read those files.",
      "And, I think that if we stand any chance of succeeding, we're gonna need some help.",
      "Nothing. Just sit there. It's completely wireless. Let me know if anything pops into your mind.",
      "(awkwardly) Uh\u2026Well, we've had a number of glitches since we, uh, last updated the operating system.",
      "Okay, fine. But it's a big planet, you know? We could really use some more manpower!",
      "(resigned) All right-all right, well, I'll see if I can find a way to disable them.",
      "(recorded video) Now\u2026I need you to listen. It is vitally important that you find this woman.",

      "You've barely got manufacturing perfected. I'm working on the coding. It-it's months away! They're not ready!",
      "Okay. I'm going to see if I can distract the guard, I need you to go\u2014",
      "I'm claustrophobic. I'm trying to keep my mind busy, which is\u2026hard because, you know, it's\u2026my mind.",
      "I don't know. It's a lot of information. Hold on\u2026I think I just hit the jackpot!",
      "They've got more darts on the way, and they've already got troops on the debris field.",
      "You know, Ronon and I could probably handle this. Maybe you should stay with the jumper.",
      "Yeah, and I've been over all of his logs. Look, this is work we've done already.",
      "Well, they've been banged around a lot, underwater for a few days. Maybe they're just broken.",
      "I've set up a sub-sonic tone generator outside. The wall is now permanently open. Don't worry.",
      "And until we start deciphering, there's no way to tell what any of this stuff does.",
      "(petulant) Well, you work on understanding them, I'll work on trying not to get us killed.",
      "I think I just found a log entry that tells us what the side effect is.",

      "Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been in this situation dozens of times. Always figured a way out.",
      "It was just common sense! (he tries to force a control, and growls) Oh, come on!",
      "That's because we haven't figured that part out yet. Look, it-it's going to be very tricky.",
      "Well, that does us absolutely no good. I mean, th-the stun field is still in effect.",
      "Ha, ha. Actually, you may want to cover the child's eyes, because this could get ugly.",
      "Either we take the data, or we send it on its way. We can't do both.",
      "Of course. This is huge. The chronicled achievements of an alien race. Are you kidding me?",

      "Of course I can. That's not the point. Look, you should be back in the infirmary.",
      "(peeved) Strange?! Doctor Keller wouldn't point a gun at me. And she certainly wouldn't stab Zelenka.",
      "Yeah, but I could've packed some extra power bars, some water, not to mention proper insoles.",
      "And we need access to that communication terminal. We need to shut it down right now!",
      "(smug) What else? You finally passed your detective exam after four years and two failed attempts\u2026",
      "You avoided jail time. The record was sealed for various \"political reasons.\" These things happen, right?",
      "Oh yeah. Lots more. Fortunately, they're in another galaxy\u2014and for now, don't know where Earth is.",
      "(scornfully) Oh, yes. He probably got a job as a Klingon at Star Trek: The Experience.",
      "I'm not entirely sure, but it looks like some kind of a cocoon. Does it hurt?",
      "Carson, is it true that Lorne and some of the others are beginning to show symptoms?",
      "Oh-kay\u2026this is weird. I'm picking up an energy signature feeding back through the wormhole. It's Wraith.",
      "No, these readings are more like something you-you'd pick up in the middle of a hive.",
      "(reluctantly) Well, I wouldn't go that far, but at least it'll be, uh\u2026not quite as deadly?",
      "(over radio) All right, all the modifications to the drive are in place. Here we go.",
      "It's a possibility, all right? The point is, we have no idea what's going on here.",
      "Let me guess, you ran into the small hiccup with the fact that you're all machines?!",

      "Right, so now I'm asking you to have dinner with me. I mean\u2026such as it is.",
      "Well, we'll be right here. If anything goes wrong\u2026 (clicks his tongue) \u2026we'll get you out.",

      "I'm going to see what I can get from the database. Let me know what the autopsy shows up.",
      "Well, I think we both knew what you were going to say long before you even went in there.",
      "Well, look, the biometric differential is not insignificant, Elizabeth. What I'm saying is\u2026the woman set off an alien alarm.",
      "And who knows what she knows about our city? More importantly, does she know about any ZPMs lying around?",
      "We can't. Whatever power's left in the system has been diverted to sustaining the shield holding the ocean back.",
      "It's too little, too late. Most of the rooms are already breached. We've got people trapped with water rising.",
      "(into radio) Elizabeth, we're going to keep trying to retract the roof. As soon as it opens, you go.",
      "I know what to do, eventually. I mean, what should I do now? Should I say something, something tonight?",
      "Well, it's just\u2026 It's a good point. I'm just wondering what I said 'cause\u2026 Sorry. What have you got?",
      "Oh, it was hard for you to say but the truth shone through, and you were compelled to speak.",
      "Well, that's enough, right? I mean even with the heavy breathing? I imagine they would calculate that in, right?",
      "Okay. On three. One, two, three\u2026 Okay. Obviously rock, paper, scissors, doesn't work with three. Anyone have a pencil?",
      "Carson I need you to clear your mind and think about the Puddle Jumper. Think about bringing it online.",

      "So that when the stargate shuts down and the forward section is severed, we're not directly exposed to space.",

      "When the stargate closes now, every molecule of air in this compartment is going to rush out through there.",
      "I'm only halfway through all the possible circuit pathways and time's almost up. We're never going to make it.",

      "So we can go where? Back to Atlantis to resume our lives? Oh yeah, I forgot. They're not ours.",
      "There's no point in denying the facts. They were telling the truth. We're not who we thought we were.",

      "Yeah, well, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter anyways, because we don't have any other choice.",
      "Now, this causes a slightly new wrinkle in the plan. I'll need to beam down to the core room.",
      "You'll be surprised to hear that, uh, removing a planet from the database is actually a lot of work.",
      "You just can't resist bringing up the fact that I once accidentally destroyed a couple of planets, can you?",
      "Well, that's our old friend, the Wraith that helped me save Jeannie and got us all those hive ships.",
      "Well, I have no idea. I think it's safe to assume that he'd know we were monitoring that frequency.",
      "Hmm. I, uh, decided to go over the remainder of ship's log for any other mention of the outpost.",
      "I promise. And I'll give you this, you're a lot more mature than the women he usually falls for.",
      "Not quickly. I mean, I can come back with a jumper and a small team and get it working.",
      "(stammering) Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I just-I tripped and\u2026fell on top of you. It was an accident.",
      "Well, we came through that section. It's been eaten away by rust. The rest of the ceiling looks fine.",
      "(angrily) All right, listen to me you little brats! I am older than you, and I am in charge!",
      "I don't know. We were sending the daily status report to the SGC, and we can't connect to Midway.",
      "No. We're completely locked out. The Wraith made sure if they couldn't have this station, then no one could.",
      "How do the populations of eight different planets get inoculated with a drug and not even know about it.",
      "And even if I do get it working, there's still a thousand things that could go terribly, terribly wrong.",
      "(over radio) Probably, but they've got dozens of ZPMs. Let's just hope that they don't\u2026notice until we're long gone.",
      "(sadly) She'd had the baby. I guess\u2026after that, he didn't have any use for her anymore\u2026So he killed her.",
      "Well, McKay did! And he brilliantly anticipated a lot of potential problems. It's just that\u2026well\u2026this wasn't one of them.",
      "I was inputting our\u2026new solar flare requirements into the long-range sensors, and\u2026I found out what happened to the ocean.",

      "I ran into them while I was trying to esc\u2014while I was effecting a strategic retreat. They stunned me.",
      "Mmm. Once again, you've read my mind. However, when you're finished there, I say you give it a shot.",
      "Well, based on the, uh\u2026 (suddenly realizing) It's the power conduits! They run pretty much through the entire city!",
      "It's no use. I've done everything I can think of to boost the sensors. They're still too far out.",
      "Let him feed off of me. Get his strength back, then he can finish the coding and save Jeanie.",
      "Of course. Life support's still not working at full power, but, uh, at least we won't freeze to death.",

      "I've been over Janus's database entries with a fine-toothed comb. I never saw any mention of a secret lab.",
      "(sarcastic) What, you mean like, does it remind me of Janus's favorite Brian Eno track? No. No such luck.",
      "Okay, so at its base level, a hyperdrive allows you to travel great distances by entering and exiting subspace.",
      "(emotional) Okay, um, I know it may not seem like it, but\u2026I want you to know, I-I-I really res\u2014",
      "Look, if we don't get in touch with Sheppard, we don't stand any chance of getting off this ship.",
      "(sighing) All right. I'll see what I can do. Give me a few minutes. That should be enough time.",
      "I don't suppose there's any chance you could just convince them that we're not guilty. 'Cause we're not, right?",
      "Aw, come on. There is no way the Pegasus Galaxy would be better off if we'd never come here.",
      "Hey, I'm just killing time 'til Woolsey gives us the green light to start data retrieval on that thing.",

      "(realizing) Right! Wait, you were legally dead a few hours ago. You were practically frozen. You really want to\u2026",
      "Well, they could've preprogrammed the ship to fly here on its own, enter orbit, even send a prerecorded signal.",
      "Look, I don't know what to tell you, all right? I pulled that schematic directly from the ship's database.",
      "He knows more about this ship than anyone. Maybe he can help me figure out what wrong with it.",
      "No, we're going to survive reentry. In fact, it'll even slow us down a little. But nowhere near enough.",
      "That field medic\u2026the one you defied orders to go back and try and rescue\u2026you knew her personally. You were\u2026involved.",
      "Recalibrating the scanners to look for similar isotopes at maximum sensitivity just shows us huge patches of radioactive desert.",
      "No. It couldn't have been. Most of the energy meant to carry the Wraith transmission went through the rift.",
      "Right, so for four years, they've been waiting to get someone in who will finally do things their way.",
      "Well, I wouldn't worry about it. I mean, uh, the fact that Sheppard's here makes all the difference, right?",
      "Yeah, but if we want to get there in time to make a difference, we need a full complement.",
      "It is? Uh, gah, I didn't sleep at all, I was up all night thinking about this Ronon situation.",
      "Exactly. Which leads me to believe they were tampering with it in a vain attempt to generate more power.",

He can use my body for any kind of, uh, experimentation, that might prove helpful, and, uh, oh, then I'd like to be cremated. I'd like my-my ashes to be, uh, thrown out into space from the jumper.
